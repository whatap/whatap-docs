The PHP application server's functions can be controlled.

- **whatap.stat_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Statistical data such as transactions, SQL, HTTPCALL, UserAgent, and client IP collected in every 5 minutes are applicable.

- **whatap.stat_ipurl_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Among the side menus of the project, the <Cmdname sid="side_statistics" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_statIp" className="uitext" /> menu sets whether or not to collect the statistics data. 

  :::note 

  Please see [Next document](/php/analysis-apm-trs#statiptx).

- **whatap.license** <span class='type'>String</span>

  To install the agent, set the access key granted from the server. The access key includes the agent's project and the encryption key for secured communication.

- **whatap.realtime_user_thinktime_max** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the maximum call interval credited by the same user when measuring the number of real-time users.

- **whatap.time_sync_interval_ms** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the synchronization interval between the agents and the server. For no synchronization, set it to `0`.

- **whatap.text_reset** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `0`

  The WhaTap agent does not transmit the text data once sent until the next day again because it is hashed. If a value is set different from the previous setting, the data is sent again.

  :::note

  Transaction URLs and SQL strings correspond to text data.

- **whatap.ext.error_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It activates the function to collect errors from the PHP extension module. If you have a whatap entry in _php.ini_ with a PHP compiled installation, add it to _php.ini_, not *whatap.ini*.

import Phprestartapply from "../common-items/_php-restart-apply.mdx";

<Phprestartapply />

- **whatap.ext.exception_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It activates the function to collect exceptions from the PHP extension module. If you have a whatap entry in _php.ini_ with a PHP compiled installation, add it to _php.ini_, not *whatap.ini*.

<Phprestartapply />

- **whatap.debug_gc_percent** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `200`

  It can reduce the CPU load by increasing the interval between GC calls by the whatap-php service daemon. The memory usage increases instead of reducing the CPU load. It applied up to 1000.

- **whatap.use_env_first** <span class='type'>Boolean</span> <code className="my">PHP agent v2.8.2 or later</code>

  Default `false`

  The priority of the agent configuration is that the *whatap.ini* file is applied first, followed by the environment variables. To prioritize environment variables, set the `use_env_first` option to `true`. Alternatively, you can set the environment variable as `WHATAP_USE_ENV_FIRST=true`.
