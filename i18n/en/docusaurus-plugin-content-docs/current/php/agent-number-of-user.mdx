-   **whatap.trace_user_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    Set whether or not to collect real-time users. If this value is activated, the users are traced based on the IP or PHP default cookie (PHPSESSID) and framework cookies (ci_session, Laravel_session). If your PHP compiled installation has a `whatap` entry in _php.ini_, add it to _php.ini_, not _whatap.ini_. 

{@include: ../common-items/_php-restart-apply.mdx}

-   **whatap.trace_user_using_ip** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    Set it to identify the real-time user by IP. The data can be checked in Real Time User. If the value is `false`, the users are classified based on the PHP default cookies and framework cookies (PHPSESSID, ci_session, Laravel_session). If you have a whatap entry in _php.ini_ with a PHP compiled installation, add it to _php.ini_, not _whatap.ini_.

{@include: ../common-items/_php-restart-apply.mdx}

-   **whatap.trace_user_cookie_keys** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `PHPSESSID,ci_session, laravel_session`

    Users can be identified by assigning the `session.name` value inside PHP. It is set when using a different name instead of `PHPSESSID` as the cookie key name. With comma (_,_) as the delimiter, multiple values can be set.

{@include: ../common-items/_php-restart-apply.mdx}

-   **whatap.trace_user_header_ticket** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    Set the HTTP key to differentiate users by a specific value in the HTTP header. Note that the `trace_user_using_ip` setting cannot be applied simultaneously. If the HTTP key cannot be found, users can be identified based on the cookies. If your PHP compiled installation has a `whatap` entry in _php.ini_, add it to _php.ini_, not _whatap.ini_.

{@include: ../common-items/_php-restart-apply.mdx}

-   **whatap.trace_user_set_cookie** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    To identify users, the user identification values are set as `WHATAP` key names in cookies. If `trace_user_using_ip` is set, this value is not applied. If `trace_user_header_ticket` is set, this is set when the header key cannot be found. If the HTTP key cannot be found, users can be identified based on cookies. If your PHP compiled installation has a `whatap` entry in _php.ini_, add it to _whatap.ini_, not _php.ini_.

{@include: ../common-items/_php-restart-apply.mdx}

-   **whatap.trace_http_client_ip_header_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `X-Forwarded-For`

    This added function sets the client IP (remote IP) with a specific HTTP header value. In the proxy environment, the `X-Forwarded-For` header value can be set with the client IP.

{@include: ../common-items/_php-restart-apply.mdx}

-   **whatap.trace_http_client_ip_header_key_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    If the value is `false`, the HTTP Header is ignored and the client IP is set as the remote IP value.
