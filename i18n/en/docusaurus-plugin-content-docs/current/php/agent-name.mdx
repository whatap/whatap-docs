:::note

- In WhaTap Monitoring, the object and agent can be used interchangeably as the monitoring target.

The default patterns used to identify the application server are as follows:

```javascript title='object_name - default pattern'
{type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{process}-{dockerid}-{ips}
```

The default pattern can be modified in _whatap.ini_.

| Configuration | Description                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type          | Use the value set in whatap.app_name.                               |
| Ip#           | When IPs are divided by period (.), the #th digit (from 0) is used. |
| process       | Use the value set in whatap.app_name.                               |
| hostname      | The server host name is used.                                       |
| dockerid      | Docker container ID                                                 |
| ips           | Full IP (IPv4, IPv6)                                                |

- **whatap.object_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `{type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{process}`

  It is an agent naming (ONAME) scheme to identify applications. An OID is created based on the ONAME.  

  <Phprestartwhatapservice />

- **whatap.app_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It is a component of the agent name (ONAME) to identify applications. The value corresponds to `{type}` of `object_name`.  

  <Phprestartwhatapservice />

- **whatap.app_process_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It is a component used in the agent naming (ONAME) scheme to identify applications. It sets the target process to collect data of the application server such as CPU and heap memory by using application process names. The value corresponds to the `{process}` of the `object_name`.  

  <Phprestartwhatapservice />

<OkindNodename />
