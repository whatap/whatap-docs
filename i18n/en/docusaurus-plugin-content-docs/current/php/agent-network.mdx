The following provides the method how to set the communication for the PHP application server.

- **whatap.server.host** <span class='type'>ip_address</span>

  Default `127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1`

  Set the server to transfer the data collected by the agent. If there are multiple IPs due to the collection server redundancy, they can be specified by separating with comma (,). The collection server's proxy daemon must be serviced in the listening state for the specified IP.

- **whatap.server.port** <span class='type'>tcp_port</span>

  Default `6600`

  Set the collection server's port. Only one port can be specified. The collection servers specified in whatap_server_host must use the same port.

- **whatap.tcp_so_timeout** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `60000`

  Set the socket timeout of the TCP session that communicates with the collection server.

- **whatap.tcp_connection_timeout** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `5000`

  Set the connection time out of the TCP session that communicates with the collection server.

- **whatap.net_send_max_bytes** <span class='type'>Byte</span>

  Default `5242880`

  Set the maximum size of the data to send to the collection server at one time.

- **whatap.net_udp_port** <span class='type'>tcp_port</span>

  Default `6600`

  The WhaTap agent transfers the data collected from the tracer through UDP communication to the collection server. You can specify the port of the first UDP server. If the provided port 6600 is in use, you can use this option. If you have a WhaTap entry in _php.ini_ by a PHP compiled installation, add it to _php.ini_, not _whatap.ini_.
