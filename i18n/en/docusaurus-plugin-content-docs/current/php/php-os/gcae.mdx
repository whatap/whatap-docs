## Custom Docker

To install the PHP monitoring agent in the Google Cloud App engine, the custom docker must be used. 

**Defaults of Google App Engine PHP cannot run PHP extension modules and service daemons**. Install them via Docker Container. 

In the _app.yaml_ file (Google App engine's configuration file), configure the settings with the `flex` environment and `custom` run-time.

```yaml title=SH
$ vi app.yaml
env: flex
runtime: custom
```

To run with the custom Docker, create _Dockerfile_ in the same location as _app.yaml_ set with the `flex` environment and the `custom` run-time. See the default PHP Docker image for the Google App engine.

```docker title=Docker
# google-appengine php php56, php70, php71
FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/php56
```

## Installation of the PHP monitoring agent

Install the PHP monitoring agent.

1. Install the library (wget).

   ```docker
   RUN apt-get install wget -y
   ```

2. Create the php-fpm execution command link.

   ```docker
   RUN ln -s /opt/php/sbin/php-fpm /usr/bin/php-fpm
   ```

3. Install the WhaTap repository and whatap-php package.

   ```docker
   RUN wget http://repo.whatap.io/debian/release.gpg -O -| apt-key add -
   RUN wget http://repo.whatap.io/debian/whatap-repo_1.0_all.deb
   RUN dpkg -i whatap-repo_1.0_all.deb
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN apt-get install whatap-php
   ```

4. Configure the PHP extension module and whatap-php service.

   ```docker
   #RUN (echo "[granted access key]"; echo "[granted server IP ]")|/usr/whatap/php/install.sh
   RUN (echo "xxxxxxxx"; echo "1.1.1.1/2.2.2.2")|/usr/whatap/php/install.sh
   ```

   :::note

   After creating a PHP monitoring project, the **access key** and server IP is issued. With the delimiter (_/_), multiple IPs can be issued.

   :::

5. Run the whatap-php service through `supervisor`.

   ```docker
   RUN echo "[program:whatap-php]" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "command = /etc/init.d/whatap-php start" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "stdout_logfile = /dev/stdout" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "stderr_logfile = /dev/stderr" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "user = root" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "autostart = true" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "autorestart = true" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "priority = 10" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
   ```

## Adding firewall rules

Add firewall rules for the network that is used by the Google App engine. TCP transmission must be allowed through the port 6600 for the issued server IP.

## Checking the deployment and instance

Deploy _app.yaml_ and _Dockerfile_ that have been set through the Google Cloud SDK.

```bash title=SH
$ gcloud app deploy
```

Check the App engine instance generated in the Google Cloud Console.
