To block direct access to the external network from the monitored servers and allow external access through a single channel, you can configure a TCP/UDP proxy server to send data to the WhaTap server.

If it is difficult for you to configure a proxy server, you can use the software-based **WhatTap software proxy** provided by WhaTap. 
This allows you to control multiple servers indirectly via **WhatTap software proxy** to the external network. You can also use the general-purpose proxy such as [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org).

## Software proxy

### Agent Installation

If you proceed with installation according to the agent installation guide, you can download the _whatap.agent.java.tar.gz_ file. After unzipping, store the _whatap.agent.proxy-`X.Y.Z`.jar_ file to a server repository that can communicate with the WhaTap collection server. If you already have an agent installed, you can use the files in the repository.

:::tip

To set the port number to pass through a proxy when installing the server agent in a Windows environment, execute the following command.

```powershell
whatap_infra.exe /SILENT /SERIAL={Access key} /PROXYIP={Proxy server IP} /PROXYPORT=6600
```

:::

### Agent CONFIG.

In this document, the bandwidth of the server where the agent has been located is called **Private Subnet**, and the bandwidth of the server where the software proxy has been located is called **Public Subnet**.

#### Public Subnet

After copying the _whatap.agent.proxy-`X.Y.Z`.jar_ file to an appropriate path, create a _proxy.conf_ file to set the WhaTap collection server IP and port. The path where the _whatap.agent.proxy-`X.Y.Z`.jar_ file has been located is `$PROXY_HOME`.

```ini title='$PROXY_HOME/proxy.conf'
whatap.server.host=52.78.209.94/52.78.224.235 ## Address of the WhaTap application monitoring collection server
listen_port=6600 ## Port to which the proxy listens
```

#### Private Subnet

`$WHATAP_HOME` is the path where the agent has been installed. In `$WHATAP_HOME`_/whatap.conf_, change `whatap.server.host` to the IP of the **Public Subnet** server.

```ini title='$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf'
whatap.server.host={Public Subnet proxy server IP}
```

For stability, you can configure multiple proxies on **Public Subnets**. Enter forward slash (/) as the delimiter.

```ini title='$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf'
whatap.server.host={Public Subnet proxy server IP #1}/{Public Subnet proxy server IP #2} 
```

### Running the agent

Run the software proxy through the `java` command or by creating a _proxy.sh_ (_proxy.bat_) file.

```bash title='java command'
java -jar whatap.agent.proxy-X.Y.Z.jar &
```

```bash title='proxy.sh (Windows: proxy.bat)'
#!/usr/bin/env bash 
EXE_JAR=`ls *.proxy* | sort | tail -1` 
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java ${JAVA_OPTS} -jar $EXE_JAR
```

```bash
sh proxy.sh &
```

:::note

When creating and running the _proxy.sh_ (_proxy.bat_) file, grant execution role with the `$ chmod +x proxy.sh` command.

:::

### Ending the software proxy

If a software proxy is running, it creates _$PROXY_HOME/{PID}.proxy.run_ files. If you delete this file, the software proxy is ended.

## HAProxy

It explains how to build a proxy server by using **HAProxy**.

### Private Subnet

```ini title='$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf'
license=<project access key>
whatap.server.host=192.168.203.60 ## Proxy server IP
```

### Public Subnet

See the following to configure the _haproxy.cfg_ file.

```ini title='/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg'
frontend proxy_in
  mode              tcp
  bind              *:6600
  default_backend   proxy_out
  log               global
  option            httplog

backend proxy_out
  mode      tcp
  server    server1 13.124.11.223:6600 maxconn 32 
  server    server2 13.209.172.35:6600 maxconn 32
```

:::note

13.124.11.223:6600 and 13.209.172.35:6600 are the WhaTap application monitoring collection server's IP address and port.

## Nginx reverse proxy

It explains how to build a proxy server by using **Nginx reverse proxy**.

### Private Subnet

```ini title='$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf'
license=<project access key>
whatap.server.host=192.168.203.60 ## Proxy server IP
```

### Public Subnet

See the following to configure the _nginx.conf_ file.

```apacheconf title='/etc/nginx/nginx.conf'
stream {
  upstream tcp_proxy {
    server 13.124.11.223:6600;
    server 13.209.172.35:6600;
  }
  server {
    listen 6600;
    proxy_pass tcp_proxy;
  }
}
```

:::note

13.124.11.223:6600 and 13.209.172.35:6600 are the WhaTap application monitoring collection server's IP address and port.

## Checking the agent installation

If there is a connection between the server where the agent has been installed and the collection server, you can check it at [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io).
