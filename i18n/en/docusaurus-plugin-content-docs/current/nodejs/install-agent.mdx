To use the Node.js monitoring service, the monitoring agent must be installed on the monitored application. For installation, use NPM (Node Package Manager).

- Install the WhaTap agent module in the active Node.js application directory.

- Write the configuration of WhaTap agent (*whatap.conf*).

- Run the Node.js service again.

import Createprojectv2 from "../getting-started/_create-project-v2.mdx";

<Createprojectv2 />

import Accesskeyv2 from "../getting-started/_accesskey-v2.mdx";

<Accesskeyv2 />

## Download agent

1. Install the agent in the active Node.js application directory.

   ```bash
   $ npm install --save whatap
   ```

2. Copy the *whatap.conf* file in the _node_modules/whatap_ path and then paste it into the root path of the project (same location as in the _package.json_ file).

3. Go to the [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io).

4. Select the created project and then copy the following among the **_downloaded items from the agent_** in the **_Install guide_** section.

   ```ini title='Example'
   license={access key}
   whatap.server.host={collection server IP}
   ```

5. Paste it into the *whatap.conf* file.

The host (`whatap.server.host`) address is the server address in which the WhaTap proxy has been installed. You can use a forward slash (/) as the delimiter to enter all addresses of the servers where the proxy server is running among the WhaTap servers.

For the agent configuration file, see the following.

:::tip

Server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks such as **Next.js** and **Nuxt.js** require the Custom Server settings for application monitoring. It requires an approach different from typical Node.js frameworks (e.g. Express.js, Nest.js). For more information, see the following:

- [Agent installation in the Next.js environment](install-agent-nextjs)

- [Agent installation in the Nuxt.js environment](install-agent-nuxtjs)

## Using

### Set the WHATAP_HOME environment variable

Set the application directory path to the WHATAP_HOME environment variable. If you do not specify it, the current working directory (process.cwd()) is used by default.

```bash
export WHATAP_HOME={app_root_path}
```

Create a *whatap.conf* file in the WHATAP_HOME path and set the following values.

```bash
# whatap.conf
app_name=MyNodeApp              # Application name, default: NODE
app_process_name=node           # Process name (for example, node)
```

### Configure the agent

Add the following code at the top of the entry point (main module) file of the application. For example, in the Express.js application, *app.js* and *server.js* are the entry points (main module). When using a framework like Nest.js, *main.ts* is the entry point.

<Tabs groupId="javascript">

<TabItem value="commonjs" label="CommonJS">

```javascript title='CommonJS'
var whatap = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ecmascript" label="ECMAScript Module(ESM)">

```javascript title="ECMAScript Module(ESM)"
import WhatapAgent from 'whatap';
WhatapAgent.NodeAgent;
```

:::note

Because the agent executable code needs to be run first after starting node.js, it must be placed before the first `import`.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Setting agent options by environment

To apply settings tailored to each environment of the application, you can modify the settings in the entry point file of the application instead of the *whatap.conf* file. Noting the code below, apply the settings tailored to your environment.

```jsx
process.env.WHATAP_CONF = 'whatap_dev.conf'; // Setting for development environment
var WhatapAgent = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
```

- **In case different projects are run for each environment**

  Even for the same application, settings are required for each environment, such as development (dev), test (test), and operation (prod). As in the example above, you can use the `WHATAP_CONF` environment variables to apply settings that are appropriate for the development environment. This allows you to easily manage different settings for each environment.

- **In case you must configure different agent options depending on the environment**

  For development environment, you can increase the logging level. In production environment, you can configure different options for performance optimization. In this case, modify the agent options in the application's entry point file to suit the environment.

- **In case of running applications in cluster mode for PM2** 

  When you run multiple application instances in cluster mode, the system consolidates them and displays them under a single `app_name(WHATAP_HOME)`.

### Using the agent group unit function

Agent group unit function includes group topology and integrated topology. Replace `{group identifier}` with agent group name in the following code.

```jsx
process.env.WHATAP_OKIND = '{group identifier}';
var WhatapAgent = require('whatap').NodeAgent;

// Or write the following in whatap.conf
whatap.okind = {group identifier}
```

### Options that can be configured as environment variables

Because you cannot use the *whatap.conf* file, set the WhaTap agent options as environment variables in the source file.

```javascript title='app.js'
process.env.profile_http_header_enabled=false;
process.env.profile_http_parameter_enabled=false;

process.env.profile_basetime=500;

process.env.auto_oname_enabled=false;
process.env.auto_oname_prefix='nodejs';

process.env.mtrace_rate=0;
process.env.mtrace_spec='v1';
process.env.stat_mtrace_enabled=false;
process.env.stat_domain_enabled=false;
```

:::note

For more information about the options that can be set in Node.js, see [the following](set-agent).
