To use the Node.js monitoring service, the monitoring agent must be installed on the monitored application. For installation, use NPM (Node Package Manager).

- Install the WhaTap agent module in the active Node.js application directory.

- Write the configuration of WhaTap agent (*whatap.conf*).

- Run the Node.js service again.

import Createprojectv2 from "../getting-started/_create-project-v2.mdx";

<Createprojectv2 />

import Accesskeyv2 from "../getting-started/_accesskey-v2.mdx";

<Accesskeyv2 />

## Download agent

1. Install the agent in the active Node.js application directory.

   ```bash
   $ npm install --save whatap
   ```

2. Copy the *whatap.conf* file in the _node_modules/whatap_ path and then paste it into the root path of the project (same location as in the *package.json* file).

3. Go to the [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io).

4. Select the created project and then copy the following among the **_downloaded items from the agent_** in the **_Install guide_** section.

   ```ini title='Example'
   license={access key}
   whatap.server.host={collection server IP}
   ```

5. Paste it into the *whatap.conf* file.

The host (`whatap.server.host`) address is the server address in which the WhaTap proxy has been installed. You can use a forward slash (/) as the delimiter to enter all addresses of the servers where the proxy server is running among the WhaTap servers.

For the agent configuration file, see the following.

:::tip

Server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks such as **Next.js** and **Nuxt.js** require the Custom Server settings for application monitoring. It requires an approach different from typical Node.js frameworks (e.g. Express.js, Nest.js). For more information, see the following:

- [Agent installation in the Next.js environment](install-agent-nextjs)

- [Agent installation in the Nuxt.js environment](install-agent-nuxtjs)

:::

## Using

Add the following code at the top of the entry point (main module) file of the application. For example, in the Express.js application, _app.js_ and _server.js_ are the entry points (main module). When using a framework like Nest.js, _main.ts_ is the entry point.

<TabItem value="commonjs" label="CommonJS">

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ecmascript" label="ECMAScript Module(ESM)">

```javascript title="ECMAScript Module(ESM)"
import WhatapAgent from 'whatap';
WhatapAgent.NodeAgent;
```

:::note

Because the agent executable code needs to be run first after starting node.js, it must be placed before the first `import`.

### Setting agent options by environment

To apply settings tailored to each environment of the application, you can modify the settings in the entry point file of the application instead of the *whatap.conf* file. Noting the code below, apply the settings tailored to your environment.

```javascript
process.env.WHATAP_CONF = 'whatapdev'; // Setting for development environment
process.env.WHATAP_NAME = 'NodeAgent-{ip2}-{ip3}-{cluster}'; //Dynamically configure agent name with IP and cluster info
var WhatapAgent = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
```

- **In case different projects are run for each environment**

  Even for the same application, settings are required for each environment, such as development (dev), test (test), and operation (prod). As in the example above, you can use the `WHATAP_CONF` environment variables to apply settings that are appropriate for the development environment. This allows you to easily manage different settings for each environment.

- **In case you must configure different agent options depending on the environment**

  For development environment, you can increase the logging level. In production environment, you can configure different options for performance optimization. In this case, modify the agent options in the application's entry point file to suit the environment.

- **In case of running applications in cluster mode for PM2** 

  When running multiple application instances in cluster mode, you can apply separate agent options to each individual instance. In this case, you can also configure a flexible monitoring by applying environment-specific settings in the entry point file instead of the configuration file.

:::note

The arguments that can be set by the `WHATAP_NAME` option are as follows.

- **ipN**: ip0, ip1, ip2, ip3

- **cluster**: Cluster ID

- **pid**: Process ID

- **hostname**: Host name

:::

### Using the agent group unit function

Agent group unit function includes group topology and integrated topology. Replace `{group identifier}` with agent group name in the following code.

```javascript
process.env.WHATAP_OKIND = '{group identifier}';
var WhatapAgent = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
```

## PaaS application environment

### Configuring the default environment variables

When installing the agent in the PaaS application, all settings must be configured in the source file (_app.js_). The *whatap.conf* file cannot be used.

Set the access key (`WHATAP_LICENSE`) and collection server IP (`WHATAP_SERVER_HOST`) as environment variables.

```javascript title='app.js'
process.env.WHATAP_LICENSE={Access Key};
process.env.WHATAP_SERVER_HOST={Collection Server IP};
var whatap=require('whatap').NodeAgent;
...
```

### Options that can be configured as environment variables

Because you cannot use the *whatap.conf* file, set the WhaTap agent options as environment variables in the source file.

```javascript title='app.js'
process.env.profile_http_header_enabled=false;
process.env.profile_http_parameter_enabled=false;

process.env.profile_basetime=500;

process.env.auto_oname_enabled=false;
process.env.auto_oname_prefix='nodejs';

process.env.mtrace_rate=0;
process.env.mtrace_spec='v1';
process.env.stat_mtrace_enabled=false;
process.env.stat_domain_enabled=false;
```

:::note

For more information about the options that can be set in Node.js, see [the following](set-agent).
