The following explains how to install the Node.js agent in **Nuxt.js 3** that is easy for users to install. This document has been created based on **Nuxt.js 3**.

<Steps>

## Installing the agent {#installagent}

Install the WhaTap agent by executing the following command from the root path of the project.

```bash title="BASH"
npm install whatap
```

## Creating the agent configuration file

Create the *whatap.conf* file in the root path of the project and then add the required settings. For more information about the agent configuration, see [the following](set-agent).

```ini title='whatap.conf'
license={ACCESS_KEY}
whatap.server.host={COLLECTION_SERVER_IP}
```

## Building the Nuxt application

Build the Nuxt application by executing the following command:

```bash title="BASH"
npm run build
```

When the build is completed, a _.output/server_ directory is created. For the directory structure, see the following.

<Filetree name=".output/server/" open>

<FiletreeItem name="chunks/" type="folder">Chunk files (Code-splitted Java script files)</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="node_modules/" type="folder">Dependency modules required to run the server</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="package.json" type="file">Application information and dependency management document</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="index.mjs" type="file">Server entry point file</FiletreeItem>

</Filetree>

## Running the application

Use the following command to run the application.

```bash title="BASH"
node -r whatap .output/server/index.mjs
```

</Steps>

## Running in the Decker environment

To run your Nuxt application in the Docker environment, add the following steps in _Dockerfile_:

1. Go to the _.output/server_ directory.

   ```bash title="BASH"
   cd .output/server
   ```

2. Execute the following command to install the WhaTap agent.

   ```bash title="BASH"
   npm install whatap
   ```

   :::note

   After building the application, install the **whatap** package with a separate command, because the **whatap** package does not exist in the _.output/server_ path. It is a tree shaking feature of **Nuxt.js**, which prevents packages that are not used in the code from being included in the build.

   :::

3. Create the *whatap.conf* file and then perform configuration.

4. Copy the configured _.output/server_ path to `WORKDIR`.

5. Use the following command to run the application.

   ```bash title="BASH"
   node -r whatap .output/server/index.mjs
   ```
