WhaTap AI Chatbot is an intelligent conversational interface that allows users to ask questions in natural language, and the AI understands and responds in real time with appropriate answers.  
Unlike simple keyword searches, this chatbot provides a conversational user experience that understands context and delivers goal-oriented information.

Specialized for the WhaTap Monitoring Service, the chatbot can automatically provide configuration guides, feature explanations, version information, and usage examples based on user questions.  
For example, when users ask how to create a specific dashboard, register a log parser, or request SQL analysis, the chatbot provides immediate answers.

WhaTap AI Chatbot is especially useful in the following cases:

- When it is difficult to find product manuals or guides  
- When complex settings or metric interpretations are needed  
- When quick information sharing between developers and operators is required  

Currently offered in beta, the service will continue to improve and support more languages and features in the future.

:::info

The WhaTap AI Chatbot service is built on a Node.js-based backend server, using a Milvus vector database and MinIO object storage. It delivers fast and accurate answers by integrating with internal documents and data through a high-performance search and response system.
