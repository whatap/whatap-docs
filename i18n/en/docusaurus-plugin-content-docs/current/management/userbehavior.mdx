The WhaTap monitoring service automatically detects the interactions conducted by users in the project, providing insight into user behaviors. You can see the menus and functions commonly used by project members. If a problem occurs due to incorrect project settings, you can quickly detect and respond to it by tracing user behaviors. Through this, you can detect and prevent security issues.
