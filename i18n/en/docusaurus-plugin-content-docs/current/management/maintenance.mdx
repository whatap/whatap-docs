**Disabling the alerts using the maintenance plan**<ScrollToLink anchor='scrollTo-v1-event-temp-pause' />

You can temporarily **disable** **alerts** during the maintenance plan execution time. This feature is designed to prevent unnecessary alerts while performing maintenance activities and other scheduled tasks so that the administrators can focus on their tasks. Warning alerts are temporarily stopped for the duration of the maintenance plan and then re-enabled upon completion of the maintenance plan after the administrator ends his or her task.

If you want to disable warning alerts at a specific time zone, you can set it through the Repeat and Time Zone options in **_Maintenance Plan Settings_**. For example, if you do not want to receive alerts every Wednesday from 1 am to 4 am, see the following example image. When you add the **_Maintenance Plan_** to run at a specified time through **_Repeat_**, **_Day_**, and **_Time_** settings, the warning alerts are disabled.
