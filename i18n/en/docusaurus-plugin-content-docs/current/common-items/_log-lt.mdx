In **_Live Tail_**, you can easily check the log data stream on the monitoring screen without accessing the server console. You can select necessary logs from numerous logs and quickly recognize the desired logs through the highlight function.

In **_Live Tail_**, complex logs can be easily accessed. You can search the logs in real time by using the functions such as **_Filter_** or **_Highlight_**, if necessary. The log data search cycle is 2 seconds. {@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-main-term.mdx}

<ImgLang img='log-lt-contents-filter.png' desc='Content Filter'/>

-   Enter the filter in the input field and then click ![Icon](/img/ic-search.svg) **_Search_**. You can filter the log data on the client and then look it up in the ![number-s3](/img/number-03.png) area. 

-   Content strings including the keyword are highlighted.

-   You can filter by single or multiple keywords.

### Content filtering condition

When filtering with multiple keywords, write as follows.

| String to input       | Description                                                           | Result            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `a b c`               | Separate each keyword with a space.                                   | a, b, c           |
| `"Whatap is good."`   | To include spaces in keywords, wrap them in '`'` or `""`.             | Whatap is good.   |
| `"Whatap\\ is good."` | If `\` is included in the keyword surrounded by "", enter it as `\\`. | Whatap\\ is good. |

### Highlight

The highlight function is provided to easily identify the desired keywords.

-   The settings are saved in **Project Rules**.
