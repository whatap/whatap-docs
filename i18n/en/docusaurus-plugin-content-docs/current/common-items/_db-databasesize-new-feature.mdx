It aggregates the sizes of tables for each database and provides trend data in a chart. 

<InDoc product='mysql'>

MySQL database size can be seen in `information_schema.tables`, and the monitoring account must have the table search role for aggregation. Role settings are required as follows.

```sql
grant select on {DB_NAME}.* to whatap;
```

:::note

- The sizes for `information_schema` and `performance_schema` are not collected. 

- The collection cycle is collected once every hour.

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

The total database size is queried with the `pg_database_size` function, and the monitoring account must have the connect or `pg_read_all_stats` role. `template database` is excluded from collection.

Individual table sizes can be queried with the `pg_relation_size`, `pg_indexes_size`, and `pg_total_relation_size` functions, and the query role for the corresponding schema is required.

```sql
grant pg_read_all_stats to whatap;
grant usage on schema {schema_name} to whatap;
```

:::note

- The sizes for the `pg_catalog`, `sys`, `information_schema`, and `pg_toast` schemata are not collected.

- The collection cycle is collected once every hour.

## Checking the changes over time

If you select the graph bar at a specific time in **_Size trend_**, you can see the database size trend and change amounts from the start time to the selected time in a list.

## Checking the sizes for each table

If you select a database in **_Size details_**, you can see the list of sizes for each table in the top 50.

<InDoc product='mysql'>

It displays **DATA SIZE**, **INDEX SIZE**, **ROWS** for each table by default. This is the information for `information_schema.tables` and may differ from the actual size. To see the **FILE SIZE** of `information_schema.innodb_tablespaces`, set the following option in the DBX agent. This size is close to the actual size.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
table_filesize=true
```

:::note

It targets the tables for which the monitoring account has the query role. For more information about the monitoring account creation, see [the following](install-agent#uid).
