**Requirements**

The WhaTap Kubernetes agent 1.7.6 or later is required. Timeline data is provided from the time point collected in version 1.7.6 or later.

:::

The <UI>{props.menu}</UI> menu provides the feature to visually trace state changes of {props.object} over time. You can visually see when the terminated {props.object} was terminated, and which state {props.object} was in at a specific time point. This allows you to analyze the past status, identify the causes of issues in the cluster, and monitor the operational stability.

## Basic screen guide

After entering the <UI>{props.menu}</UI> menu, select <Cmdname sid="TTL06740" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="TTL08842" className="uitext" /> to view the data. You can see the {props.object} list collected in the last 1 hour. You can visually see the state changes of {props.object} along the time axis.

If you hover your mouse over each time zone, the start and end times of it and Pod status (***Running***, ***Pending***, ***Succeeded***, ***Failed***) appear.
