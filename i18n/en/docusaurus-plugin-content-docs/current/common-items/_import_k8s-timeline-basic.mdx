**Requirements**

The WhaTap Kubernetes agent 1.7.6 or later is required. Timeline data is provided from the time point collected in version 1.7.6 or later.

:::

The <UI>{props.menu}</UI> menu provides the feature to visually trace state changes of {props.object} over time. You can visually see when the terminated {props.object} was terminated, and which state {props.object} was in at a specific time point. This allows you to analyze the past status, identify the causes of issues in the cluster, and monitor the operational stability.

## Basic screen guide

After entering the <UI>{props.menu}</UI> menu, select <Cmdname sid="TTL06740" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="TTL08842" className="uitext" /> to view the data. You can see the {props.object} list collected in the last 1 hour. You can visually see the state changes of {props.object} along the time axis.

<InDoc pages="pod-timeline">

If you hover your mouse over each time zone, the start and end times of it and Pod status (***Running***, ***Pending***, ***Succeeded***, ***Failed***) appear.

You can adjust the time range by dragging the zone on the timeline. Set a desired period to check the past data.

Additionally, when you select a specific period, you can check the {props.object} status during the period in detail through **Display Detail**. For more information, see the [{props.object} timeline detail](#timeline-details) guidance. 

{/\* A list of nodes collected over the past 7 days is displayed as follows. You can visually see the state changes of nodes along the time axis. If you hover your mouse over each time zone, the start and end times for the zone appears as tooltips together with the node's status (***Ready***, ***NotReady***, etc.).

You can check the Pod status (Running, Pending, Succeeded, Failed) at a specific time point. 
You can filter by the Pod name, namespace, and such. It visualizes the data collected over the past hour based on the time axis, and provides tooltips with detailed information such as Pod status, start time, and end time when you hover your mouse over it. You can drag a specific time range to view historical data, and click a specific Pod to view detailed information about the Pod, including resource usage, running containers, and ownerReference. \*/}
