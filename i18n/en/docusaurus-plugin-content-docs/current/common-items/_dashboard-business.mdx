The **Business Dashboard** allows you to monitor application performance by business unit (App Context).  
You can analyze both real-time and historical performance data for each business context, defined by URL patterns or paths.  
By viewing key metrics like TPS, response time, and error rate per business context, you can quickly identify performance issues in specific operations or services.
