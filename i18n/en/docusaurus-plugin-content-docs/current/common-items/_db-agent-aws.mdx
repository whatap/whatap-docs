You can configure it more easily and intuitively through the <Cmdname sid="side_dbCloudSetting" className="uitext" /> menu. Through this menu, you can additionally collect and monitor monitoring metrics provided by cloud services on the dashboard of the database project. For more information, see [the following](cloudsettings).

- **aws_region** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the AWS region.

- **aws_arn** <span class='type'>String</span>

  You can use the ARN of an IAM ROLE with appropriate roles for AWS authentication.

  <details>

  <summary>Required role</summary>

  For the roles, the following policies are required.

  | Role                              | Role details                                                     |
  | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | rds:DescribeDBInstances           | Collection of the instance class data                            |
  | rds:DescribeDBClusters            | Collection of cluster data when using the autoscale              |
  | rds:DescribeDBLogFiles            | Collection of CloudWatch logs                                    |
  | rds:DownloadDBLogFilePortion      | Collection of CloudWatch logs                                    |
  | ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes         | Collection of CPU counts for each instance class                 |
  | elasticache:DescribeCacheClusters | Collection of instance class data when using the elasticache     |
  | cloudwatch:ListMetrics            | Collection of the list of CloudWatch metrics                     |
  | cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics    | Collection of the values of the CloudWatch metrics               |
  | logs:DescribeLogStreams           | Collection of CloudWatch logs (in case of using the posted logs) |
  | logs:GetLogEvents                 | Collection of CloudWatch logs (in case of using the posted logs) |

  </details>

- **cloud_watch** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set whether or not to use the CloudWatch Monitoring. The value is `on` or `off`.

- **cloud_watch_instance** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the instance name of the CloudWatch.

- **cloud_watch_interval** <span class='type'>Second</span>

  Set the interval to get monitoring values by CloudWatch (unit: second).

- **cloud_watch_metrics** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the monitoring metric name to be imported into the CloudWatch. You can set it as follows:

  ```ini
  cloud_watch_metrics=CPUUtilization,FreeableMemory,FreeStorageSpace,NetworkTransmitThroughput,NetworkReceiveThroughput
  ```

### Example of configuration for RDS CloudWatch collection

You must create the following default settings to monitor the RDS CloudWatch and collect the related data.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
cloud_watch=on
aws_region=ap-northeast-2

# Create roles in AWS IAM and then copy and paste the role ARN value.
aws_arn=arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/UpdateApp
cloud_watch_metrics=CPUUtilization,FreeableMemory,FreeStorageSpace,NetworkTransmitThroughput,NetworkReceiveThroughput

#Example of the instance name
cloud_watch_instance=pg-rds

#When using slow query
slow_query_log=on
```

:::note

- For more information about the **role ARN**, see the [following link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html).

- For information on how to collect data after granting the RDS CloudWatch metric collection role to EC2 without using the IAM ROLE's ARN value, see [the following](../reference/cloudwatch-metric-guide).
