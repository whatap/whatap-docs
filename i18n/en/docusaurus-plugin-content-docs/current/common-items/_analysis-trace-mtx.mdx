**Multi-transaction** means the transaction involving a different agent or project. **Multiple Transaction Trace** is to trace calls between the application services registered in the WhaTap project. 

<InDoc product="java">

:::info

The Java agent traces multi-transactions with three HTTP header keys (`x-wtap-po`, `x-wtap-mst`, and `x-wtap-sp1`). If HTTP transactions passing through the gateway cannot be traced, check the HTTP header conditions.

:::note

**Enabling the multi-transaction**

To trace multi-transactions, set the `mtrace_enabled` option to `true` in <Cmdname sid="management" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="agent_configuration" className="uitext" />. For more information about the agent configuration, see [the following](set-agent#set-agent-service).

## Checking the multi-transaction ID

To use the <Cmdname sid="multi_server_transaction_trace" className="uitext" /> menu, <b>MTID</b> (Multi Transaction ID) is required. Through the following procedure, you can find the <b>MTID</b> value.

1. In <Cmdname sid="analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="AA005" className="uitext" />, drag the chart area.

2. The transaction information in the dragged chart area is displayed in the <Cmdname sid="trace_list" className="uitext" /> list below as follows.

   <ImgLang img='tx-trace-table.png' desc='mtrace_M' />

3. If you select the trace with the ![Icon](/img/ic-s-mult-transation.svg) icon displayed, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window appears. 

4. In the <Cmdname sid="TTL06125" className="uitext" /> tab, you can see the <Cmdname sid="TTL06107" className="uitext" /> value.

   <ImgLang img='tx-trace-dt-up.png' desc='Record summary' />

:::note

- The same <Cmdname sid="TTL06107" className="uitext" /> is generated even if the transaction makes an external call. Even if projects are separated by service, all transactions between applications can be found through the initially issued <Cmdname sid="TTL06107" className="uitext" />. For more information about the detailed analysis of transaction trace through the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window, see [the following](trs-profile#transaction-info).

- If you select <Cmdname sid="TTL06107" className="uitext" /> in the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06377" className="uitext" /> tab appears. The transactions and trace data are provided so that you can see various call relationships at a glance within or between systems, and identify where problems occurred for improvement.

:::

## Using the multi-transaction tracing feature

1. Go to <Cmdname sid="analysis" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="multi_server_transaction_trace" className="uitext" />.

2. Enter the <b>MTID</b> value found in the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window into the <Cmdname sid="search_mtid_or_custid" className="uitext" /> field.

3. Select the date and project you want to query.

4. Click the <Cmdname sid="apply" className="uitext" /> button at the bottom of the screen.

    * The <Cmdname sid="apply" className="uitext" /> button becomes disabled in the following cases:
        * When the same filter values (MTID/CUSTID, date, selected project) as the previous search are set.
        * When none of the filter values (MTID/CUSTID, date, selected project) are entered.

5. The right <Cmdname sid="BTN07120" className="uitext" /> tab displays a diagram and a table that allow you to understand the call relationships of each transaction.

    :::tip
    The diagram and table areas are divided vertically, and you can adjust their ratio manually.

    - Clicking the upward arrow makes the table occupy the entire area. However, if the diagram area was occupying the entire area, the diagram and table will split into equal halves.
    - Clicking the downward arrow makes the chart (diagram) area occupy the entire area. However, if the table area was occupying the entire area, the diagram and table will split into equal halves.

### <Cmdname sid="BTN07120" />

<Cmdname sid="BTN07120" className="uitext" /> provides a fast and clear view of the call relationships between transactions.  
You can check the individual execution times of transaction services that share the same <Cmdname sid="TTL06107" className="uitext" />.  
The elapsed time displayed at the top of each transaction node (<LinkImage img="number-01.png" desc="number 1"/> <Cmdname sid="time_bar" className="uitext" />) allows you to understand the call flow between transactions.

![Chart](/img/trace-mtx-chart-timebar.png)

:::tip
You can freely move, zoom in, or zoom out of the chart with your mouse.

- Drag within the chart area to move it.
- Scroll within the chart area to move vertically or horizontally.
  - Vertical scroll: move up/down  
  - Horizontal scroll: move left/right
- Hold `Ctrl` + scroll up/down to zoom in or out.
  - Pinch zoom on a touchpad is also supported.

When you select a transaction, only the connected nodes remain active, while all unrelated nodes are dimmed.  
The **Detail View** button (<LinkImage img="number-02.png" desc="number 2"/>) at the bottom of the selected transaction becomes active.  
Clicking it opens the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window, where you can view detailed transaction information.  
For more details on analyzing transaction traces using the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window, refer to the following document: [Transaction Info](trs-profile#transaction-info).
