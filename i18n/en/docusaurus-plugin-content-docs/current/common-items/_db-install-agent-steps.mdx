1. Download the agent file. Use the following two methods.

   - On the WhaTap monitoring service screen, select **_Download_** for downloading.

   - You can download with the Linux wget method. Use the following command.

     ```bash
     wget -O whatap.agent.database.tar.gz https://api.whatap.io/download/agent/whata.agent.database.tar.gz
     ```

2. Copy the downloaded file to the server to be analyzed, and then unzip it. (Same for Windows and Linux)
