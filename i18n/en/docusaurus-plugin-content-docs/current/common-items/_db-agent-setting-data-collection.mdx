<InDoc product='oracle,tibero'>

- **tables_min_size** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `10`

  When collecting the table data, the table data smaller than the set value is not collected. The minimum collection value for the table is 10 MB by default.

- **tables_exclude_sys** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  When collecting the table data, set whether or not to collect the table data owned by sys. If set to `true`, the table data owned by sys is not collected.

<Xclude product='cubrid,redis'>

- **replication_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

  If you set the replication name, it is considered that there is a Master/Slave relationship between DBs with the same `replication_name`.

  As an option to define the replication set, if you set the `replication_name` option that has the same value for both master and slave nodes, the **_Instance Monitoring_** displays a tree structure. It also provides a widget to monitor the replication status in **_Flex Board_** based on the option value.

</Xclude>

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

- **slave_ip** <span class='type'>string</span>

  Check the IP address with `select inet_server_addr();`. It must be one of the IP addresses found when searching `pg_stat_replication.client_addr` on the master node. If the `replication_name` option value is the same and it is a slave DB, specify `slave_ip`.

  :::note

  In case of RDS, because the master/slave relationship is set with `pg_replication_slots.slot_name` instead of the IP address, the `slave_ip` option does not need to be set.

- **skip_sys_session** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1`

  If set to `2`, the sys sessions (root, system user, event_scheduler) are not visible in the active session. The set value, `1` makes sys sessions visible, but excludes them from the total runtime.

- **idle_as_active** <span class='type'>Second</span>
