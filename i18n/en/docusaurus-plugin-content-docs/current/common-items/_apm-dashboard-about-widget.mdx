## Learning about the widgets {#about-widget}

:::info

This document mainly describes the widgets placed on the <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />. For more information about how to analyze transactions and users, services, and resources through <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />, see the following documents:

- [Exploring the Application Dashboard](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard)

### Agent-related widgets

You can see the application information through the agent installed on the application.

#### <Cmdname sid="AA003" /> {#AA003}

<ImgLang img='agent-dashboard-summary.png' desc='Application summary' />

It displays the execution status and number of applications registered in the project, CPU core count, and host count.

### Transaction-related widget

The failure status that can be checked through the transaction, can be recognized through the priority response time. If a transaction in progress does not end, this should be considered a failure. WhaTap divides sections for display by the time of the progress status. <span class='normal'>Blue (Normal)</span> means transactions within the specified response time, <span class='slow'>Orange (Slow)</span> means slow transactions with the response time of around 8 seconds, and <span class='vslow'>Red (Very slow)</span> means transactions with the response time that is twice as slow as normal. This allows you to intuitively recognize failures as fast as possible.

#### <Cmdname sid="AA001" /> {#active-trs-speed}

<ImgLang img="speedmeter.png" desc="Active Transaction Speed Chart" />

You can see the status of active transactions (middle area) and completed transactions (right area). The water drop icon passing from left to right means a transaction. If you click a chart area, a pop-up window appears where you can see a list of active transactions. If you select one of the transaction lists, you can view the transaction details, SQL query, and call stack information.

- Area on the left

  This indicates the number of requested transactions and displays data in proportion to the number of transactions.

- Area in the middle

  The status of active transactions is color displayed by the speed along with the count at the upper right. The number in the chart is the total number of active transactions. The colors in the chart indicate as follows:

  - Blue (<span class='normal'>Normal</span>): 0 to 3 seconds

  - Orange (<span class='slow'>Slow</span>): 3 to 8 seconds

  - Red (<span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>): 8 seconds or more

- Area on the right

  This indicates the Application Performance Index (Apdex). This metric is measured for customer satisfaction of a web application and has a value between 0 and 1. The droplet flying speed is proportional to the total number of Apdex transactions, and the droplet colors mean as follows:

  - Blue: <span class='normal'>Apdex </span>satisfied count 

  - Orange: <span class='slow'>Apdex </span>tolerating count 

  - Red: <span class='vslow'>Apdex </span>frustrated count = `Total number of APDEX transactions` - (`Apdex satisfied count` + `Apdex tolerating count`)

  :::note

  For more information about the Application Performance Index (Apdex), see [the following link](https://www.apdex.org).

#### <Cmdname sid="AA002" /> {#active-trs}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-tx.png' desc='Active transaction' />

In the <Cmdname sid="AA002" className="uitext" /> widget, the transactions in progress are displayed in the <b>arc equalizer</b> chart. You can see the status of delays by agent. The arc is divided by the number of agents. By representing the number of requests being processed by the server every 5 seconds, you can tell how long the request has been processed. Requests detected at an interval of 5 seconds are classified by color as follows to determine whether they are dangerous or not.

- Red (<span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>): 8 seconds or more 

- Orange (<span class='slow'>Slow</span>): 3 to 8 seconds

- Blue (<span class='normal'>Normal</span>): 0 to 3 seconds

The situation where lots of blue colors are represented is not a problem. You must watch the trend to see whether some of them turn to orange or red. In case of a failure, the number of active transactions increases and the percentage of red color increases. On the other hand, a very responsive system with a high number of process transactions (TPS) might have a low number of active transactions.

- On the upper left, the agent name with the most active transactions appears.

- The middle number is a sum of active transactions of all agents.

- Two bars around active transactions rotate around the chart at a three-step rate based on the throughput (TPS).

- When you select a divided arc area, a pop-up window appears listing the transactions in progress on the agent. To check the transaction details, select an item in the transaction list. 

  <ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-tx-popup.png' desc='Transaction List' />

  :::note

  - If the item selected in the transaction list is a transaction that has already ended, select <Cmdname sid="show_trace" className="uitext" />. The <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window appears. For more information about the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window, see <Link to="trs-profile">the following</Link>.

  - For more information about transactions, see [the following](track-transactions-intro).

  :::

#### <Cmdname sid="AA018" /> {#active-trs-agent}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-tx-agent.png' desc='Agent Active Transaction' />

The <Cmdname sid="AA002" className="uitext" /> widget displays on a chart the data merged based on the criteria selected in the agent selection options. On the other hand, the <Cmdname sid="AA018" className="uitext" /> widget allows you to individually check the agents included in the selected agent classification criteria.

Right-click the dashboard and then select the <Cmdname sid="AA018" className="uitext" /> widget from the widget list.

#### <Cmdname sid="AA004" /> {#active-status}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-status.png' desc='Active status' />

All agents in the project collect the active transaction count every 5 seconds, along with the progress status. The progress status is classified into <Cmdname sid="active_stat_method" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="sql" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="active_stat_httpc" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="active_stat_dbc" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="active_stat_socket" className="uitext" />.

- <Cmdname sid="active_stat_method" className="uitext" />: Status in which the method is executing. Normal situations are displayed in blue.

- <Cmdname sid="sql" className="uitext" />: SQL is running. If the <Cmdname sid="sql" className="uitext" /> number increases, check for problems connecting to the database server.

- <Cmdname sid="active_stat_httpc" className="uitext" />: It is calling any external API. If the <Cmdname sid="active_stat_httpc" className="uitext" /> number increases, it means that the server connected to outside is not responding normally.

- <Cmdname sid="active_stat_dbc" className="uitext" />: The transaction is attempting to get a new connection from the connection pool. If DB connection pools are insufficient, a delay occurs whenever a new connection request occurs, causing the performance failure. In this case, the <Cmdname sid="active_stat_dbc" className="uitext" /> number increases.

  :::note

  For more information about the DB connection delay, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dbc).

  :::

- <Cmdname sid="active_stat_socket" className="uitext" />: Indicates the TCP connection attempt to an external system. If the <Cmdname sid="active_stat_socket" className="uitext" /> number continues to increase, there is a high possibility of failures due to disconnection of the external system.

#### <Cmdname sid="AA005" /> {#AA005}

<ImgLang img='hitmap.png' desc='Hitmap' />

The <Cmdname sid="AA005" className="uitext" /> chart represents the distribution of response times of completed transactions. The horizontal axis is the transaction end time. The vertical axis is the execution time. Transactions with longer execution times are at the top of the distribution. If you drag the chart area in <Cmdname sid="AA005" className="uitext" />, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" /> window appears that you can see the transaction information details. For more information about <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, see <Link to="dashboard-hitmap-trace">the following</Link>.

- Normal transactions are displayed in light blue → blue → Indigo in order.

- Erroneous transactions are displayed in yellow → orange → red in order.

- The number on the upper right indicates the <span class='normal'>transaction count</span>/<span class='slow'>error count</span> in the chart.

- If <Cmdname sid="yaxis" className="uitext" /> is selected, the Y-axis (execution time) is automatically adjusted.

- If <Cmdname sid="err" className="uitext" /> is selected, only the error transactions appear.

- Select ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg) to zoom in/out the chart from 5 seconds to 80 seconds.

:::note

- The detailed information for the transactions with no error whose execution time is less than 500 ms is collected once every 5 minutes for each URL.

- It does not affect the statistics such as TPS and average response time.

- You can set a policy through the agent configuration. For more information, see [the following](agent-transaction).

- See the following document for the procedure to analyze transactions through the hitmap widget.

#### <Cmdname sid="AA016" /> {#AA016}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-tx-equalizer.png' desc='Active Transaction Equalizer' />

It displays a list of all agents and the total number of active transactions. Hover your mouse over each graph on the chart to display the transaction speed. The transaction speeds are classified into <span class='normal'>Normal</span>, <span class='slow'>Slow</span>, and <span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>.

- To display or hide inactive agents, select ![Agent display icon](/img/ic-inactive.svg). 

- If you select ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), the <Cmdname sid="side_multi_active_tx" className="uitext" /> menu appears.

#### Active HTTPC/SQL {#active-httpc-sql}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-httpc-sql.png' desc='Active HTTPC/SQL' />

The **Active HTTPC/SQL** widget monitors the performance of external calls (HTTP calls and database queries) occurring in the application in real time.  
Unlike the <Cmdname sid="AA002" className="uitext" /> widget, which shows all transactions, this widget is specialized for outbound calls, allowing you to quickly identify external system bottlenecks. Placing the two widgets together helps distinguish whether transaction increases are caused by external system delays or internal logic issues, enabling more effective multilayered analysis.

Ongoing HTTPC/SQL operations are visualized as an **Arc Equalizer** chart, showing latency status by host or database URL. The arc is divided by the number of hosts or database URLs, and every 5 seconds it displays the number of requests being processed on the current server and their response times. Requests detected in 5-second intervals are classified into intuitive colors according to their severity.

* Red (<span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>): 8 seconds or more

* Orange (<span class='slow'>Slow</span>): 3 to 8 seconds

* Normal: 0 to 3 seconds
  * Purple (<span class='purple'>HTTPC Normal</span>)
  * Mint (<span class='mint'>SQL Normal</span>)

A large number of Normal values is not a concern. You need to monitor if some values turn orange or red. In failure scenarios, the number of ongoing transactions increases and the proportion of red rises. Conversely, in very fast systems, TPS may be high but the number of ongoing transactions may remain low.

This widget is especially useful in microservice environments to track HTTP communication delays between services or monitor DB performance individually in systems using multiple databases. For services with many external API calls, it allows monitoring of response times by API provider, making dependency management effective.

##### Arc Equalizer Chart

This is the core visualization element of the widget, dividing ongoing HTTPC/SQL operations by host or database URL. If issues are detected in the overall transactions, this chart helps pinpoint specific external bottlenecks.

* **Top Left Indicator**: Displays the host/database URL with the most active transactions for easy identification of key targets.
* **Center Number**: Shows the total sum of active HTTPC/SQL.
* **TPS-Based Animation**: Bars around the equalizer rotate at three speeds depending on throughput (TPS), visually expressing system load.
* **5-Second Refresh**: Provides near real-time monitoring for immediate response.
* **Arc Segmentation**: Divides arcs by host/database URL for quick identification of where delays are occurring.

##### Host/Database URL Details

Selecting a segmented arc area opens a popup showing the **Top 100 ongoing transactions** for that host or database URL.

* **Transaction List**: Displays the Top 100 ongoing transactions for the selected host or database URL.
* **Trend Chart**: Shows TPS, response time, error count, and error rate trends over the last 10 minutes.
* **Transaction Details**: Selecting a transaction from the list opens detailed information.
  * For already finished transactions, select the **View Transaction** button to open the **Transaction Info** window.

1. In the **Active HTTPC Top 100** popup, check the transaction list and trends.

1. Select a transaction that requires detailed analysis.

    a. In the Arc Equalizer, click the arc for the host or database URL you want to analyze. 

1. In the Transaction Info window, review the details.

### Service-related widget

The service-related widget can be used as the metric for application performance tuning.

#### <Cmdname sid="apdex" /> {#apdex}

![Apdex](/img/apm-dashboard-apdex.png)

import Javaapdexdesc from "../common-items/_java-apdex-desc.mdx";

<Javaapdexdesc />

:::note

The default value (S) can be modified in <Cmdname sid="management" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="agent_configuration" className="uitext" />. The value of the setting key is `apdex_time`. It is available only in the agent 2.0 or later.

:::

#### <Cmdname sid="tps" /> {#tps}

![TPS](/img/apm-dashboard-tps.png)

**Transaction Per Second** (**TPS**) indicates the number of transactions processed per second and is the reference for service performance metric. The number of transactions processed every 5 seconds is converted to the number of transactions per second and is expressed with a chart. It displays TPS for the last 10 minutes.

:::note

For more information about analyses for TPS, response time, and CPU utilization, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard#analysis-user-service-resource).

:::

#### <Cmdname sid="avg_restime" /> {#avgrestime}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-avg-response-time.png' desc='Average response time'/>

It monitors the times needed for the application server to return the request result. <Cmdname sid="avg_restime" className="uitext" /> is meaningful as a tuning metric. The WhaTap's monitoring service calculates the average response time for transactions every 5 seconds.

:::note

For more information about analyses for TPS, response time, and CPU utilization, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard#analysis-user-service-resource).

:::

### Resource-related widget

#### <Cmdname sid="system_cpu" /> {#systemcpu}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-cpu.png' desc='System CPU' />

It is the CPU usage of the application server. You can see the change trend in CPU usage in real time.

:::note

For more information about analyses for TPS, response time, and CPU utilization, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard#analysis-user-service-resource).

<InDoc product="java,nodejs,golang">

#### <Cmdname sid="AA010" /> {#heap-memory}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-heap-memory.png' desc='Heap memory' />

You can see which servers are at risk by displaying the maximum available memory and the current memory for each server. The changes in memory usage over time can be seen in real time.

The memory line chart usually ripples continuously. It increases when using memory to process the requests from the application server. It decreases when memory is cleaned up through GC (Garbage Collection). <Cmdname sid="AA010" className="uitext" /> metric is displayed with average values.

### User-related widget

#### <Cmdname sid="realtime_user" /> {#realtimeuser}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-realtime-user.png' desc='Concurrent User' />

It displays the number of real-time browser users. Every 10 seconds, users who made transactions within the last 5 minutes are counted and displayed without duplicates. Users are counted based on their browser's IP.

:::note

<InDoc product='java'>

- In the agent settings, the IP or cookies can be used to distinguish users. For more information, see [the following](agent-additional-option).

</InDoc>

- In general, the connected user means a connected user who has access to the current network. However, web systems are different because they use connectionless networks. It does not mean that you are connected, but rather the user who sent the recent request can be measured.

- Real-time (concurrent access) users indicate the users who are using the system in the same time zone. There are various ways to count or measure real-time (concurrent access) users.

- The number of users is calculated by ** HyperLogLog** rather than simply adding up. ** HyperLogLog** is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the number of elements in a set with very little memory.

- For more information about the configuration of agent options for aggregating the user count, see [the following](agent-number-of-user).
