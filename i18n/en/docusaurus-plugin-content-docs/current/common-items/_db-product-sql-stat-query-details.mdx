- **Default Bind**: You can bind the part set as a variable in the query sentence to the default value.

- **Reset Bind**: You can release the bound default value and check the variable.

- **Formatting**: You can improve readability by applying indentation and formatting to a SQL query statement.

- **Runtime Plan**: It provides the execution plan and runtime information for a selected SQL query. It provides the information details such as execution count, average execution time, and average physical reads.

- **Explain Plan**: It displays the execution plan predicted by the optimizer. It provides information such as cost, job, object name, and cardinality.

- **Plan History**: You can check the history of the execution plans of the SQL queries executed in the database.

- **Bind Capture**: You can see the values ​​of the bind variables used in SQL queries executed in the database. This allows you to see actual content of query executions.

  :::note

  This is a value captured in the database (`v$sql_bind_capture`), not a bind value executed in real time. If the number of cases is too large, it displays up to 100.

* **Trend**: Provides a comprehensive analysis of the execution time, I/O, and wait events of a specific SQL to quickly identify performance bottlenecks.  
* **Runtime Plan**: Provides the execution plan and runtime information of the selected SQL query, including execution count, average execution time, and average physical reads.  
* **Explain Plan**: Displays the execution plan predicted by the optimizer, showing cost, operations, object names, cardinality, and more.  
* **Plan History**: Allows you to review the execution plan history of SQL queries executed in the database.  
* **Bind Capture**: Displays the values of bind variables used in SQL queries executed in the database, allowing you to check the actual query execution contents.  

  :::note

  These are not real-time bind values but those captured in the database (`v$sql_bind_capture`). Up to 100 entries are displayed if there are many.

#### Trend Tab

The top chart visualizes the trends of Elapsed Time, I/O, and Wait Time over time. The bottom statistics table provides a side-by-side comparison of cumulative execution statistics, Wait Class ratios, and major Wait Events.  

##### Elapsed Time

Displays the total of **CPU time, Wait Class time, and Idle time** for the selected interval.  

> Example:  
> * CPU Time: Time actually spent using the CPU for SQL execution  
> * Scheduler: Time the session waited for CPU  
> * Idle: Time spent idle or waiting without execution (quickly see which factor consumed the most time)  

##### Elapsed Time Trend

Shows the trend of **average Elapsed Time** and Execution Count aggregated in 5-minute intervals (1-minute intervals if under 3 hours).  

This helps quickly identify performance degradation by checking if Elapsed Time spiked or if response time increased compared to execution count.  

##### I/O Trend

Displays **Logical Reads** and **Physical Reads** during query execution in 5-minute intervals (1-minute intervals if under 3 hours).  

* Logical Reads: Number of times data was read from the buffer cache  
* Physical Reads: Number of times data was read directly from disk, allowing you to assess cache efficiency and I/O bottlenecks  

##### Wait Time Trend

Displays the **Wait Event times** during query execution by time interval.  

If Wait Time spikes at a certain point, it indicates DB resource contention or I/O delays. You can trace which events (lock, I/O, parallelism, etc.) caused the bottleneck.  

##### Total Statistics

Shows **cumulative SQL execution statistics** for the selected interval.  

> Example:  
> * sorts(rows): Total number of sorted rows  
> * session logical reads: Number of session logical reads  
> * table scan blocks gotten: Number of blocks read during table scans  
> * elapsed_time: Total elapsed time  
> → Provides aggregated data on how SQL execution used resources  

##### Total Wait Classes

Displays the total **Wait Time** aggregated by Wait Class during SQL execution.  
The higher the time for a particular Wait Class, the more likely it is the bottleneck.  

> Example: Idle, Scheduler, User I/O, Concurrency, etc.  

##### Top Wait Events

Shows the **top detailed Wait Events** that occurred during the selected interval.  
Provides more fine-grained detail than Wait Classes to identify which events most impacted performance.  

> Example: PX Deq: Execution Msg, resmgr:cpu quantum, direct path read, etc.
