Data is fetched at different intervals depending on the query time. The available time ranges are provided in units of **1 minute (m1), 5 minutes (m5), and 1 hour (h1)**. To change back to the recent time, click the ![Recent time icon](/img/ic-recent-time-active.svg) icon. Data is automatically adjusted according to the set time.

Detailed charts have data cycles that differ depending on the query time, just like trend charts. You can adjust the query time range by dragging.
