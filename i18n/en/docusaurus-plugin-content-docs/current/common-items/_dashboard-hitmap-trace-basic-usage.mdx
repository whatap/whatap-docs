- If you drag another area in the <Cmdname sid="AA005" className="uitext" /> widget, a new trace analysis window appears. You can check it by comparing with the previous trace analysis window.

- The transactions that are viewed can be shared with other users. With the transaction item selected (![a icon](/img/char-a.svg)), click ![b icon](/img/char-b.svg) ![copy icon](/img/ ico-copy.svg) <Cmdname sid="DSC07542" className="uitext" /> on the trace analysis window. Pass the copied URL address to another user. Any user who has received the URL address can quickly see the same items by entering the URL address in the browser address bar.
