:::note
The serverless agent is a lightweight collector designed to gather only cloud metrics in a serverless execution environment (such as Lambda or Functions) without requiring a dedicated server or program installation.  
It can be easily deployed via AWS CloudFormation or Azure Resource Manager Template, enabling quick setup with minimal management overhead.

This agent provides the same functionality as [Cloud Agent Settings](agent-cloud-settings), but is more suitable for single-instance environments where you only need to collect metrics.  
However, it does **not support log collection**. If you operate multiple instances or require log collection (e.g., via CloudWatch Logs), it is recommended to use the Cloud Agent Settings instead.
:::

It provides the feature to set up additional collection and monitoring for monitoring metrics provided by cloud services on the dashboard of the database project. Through the **Serverless Agent Settings** menu, you can monitor the resource status of the cloud database server in real time to maximize the operational efficiency.

Cloud settings allow you to collect CloudWatch metrics and slow query data. Collection of slow queries is supported only for MySQL and PostgreSQL.

- The configuration process is intuitive and easy, so even non-developers can quickly perform it. 

- After completing the configuration, you can immediately check and correct errors through visual feedbacks.

- By creating and configuring roles directly on the CSP console, you can enable granular control over security groups and policies.

:::note

After configuration, extra charge may be incurred in the cloud depending on the usage, separate from the WhaTap fee. Check the pricing policy of the cloud service in use before installation.
