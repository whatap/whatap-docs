### Handling special characters

If `DB_USER` or `DB_PASSWORD` contains special characters in MongoDB environments, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Apply percent encoding (required)

MongoDB requires <b>percent encoding</b> to be applied first when special characters are included.

**Example**

* Original password: `whatap@#`
* After percent encoding: `whatap%40%23`

:::tip

For more information about percent encoding rules, see the [MongoDB Connection String URI Format](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/) official documentation.

:::

#### Step 2: Apply escape characters (if needed)

If the password still contains special characters interpreted by the shell (`!`, `\`, `$`, etc.) after percent encoding, apply additional escape characters (`\`).

**Example**
```bash
# Basic usage
./uid.sh whatap whatap%40%23

# When shell interpretation issues occur
./uid.sh whatap whatap\%40\%23
```

:::warning Important

* MongoDB requires **percent encoding as the priority** when special characters are included.
* Application order: **Percent encoding** → **Escape characters if needed**
* Without percent encoding, UID generation may succeed but actual DB connection may fail.
