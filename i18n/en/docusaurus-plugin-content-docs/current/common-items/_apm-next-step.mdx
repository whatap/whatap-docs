- **Open source tracing**

  Depending on the framework or open source library used in applications, you may need to add agent options. For example, when using spring-boot-3.x, feign-client-11, or okhttp3-4.4 with a framework or open source, set the options as follows:

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  weaving=spring-boot-3.0,feign-11,okhttp3-4.4
  ```

  For information on how to configure the framework or open source library that suits your application environment, see [the following](../agent-weaving).

- **Checking the installation**

  If you have created a project, installed an agent, and applied all JVM options, see the checklist in [the following](../install-check).

- **Installation troubleshooting**

  It provides various problems that may occur when installing the agent and specific instructions for resolving them. It provides solutions against various situations, including firewall configuration, SpringBoot and Tomcat JMX configuration, and server configuration using the OSGI framework. For more information, see [the following](../agent-troubleshooting).

- **Agent setting**

  It provides various features for monitoring by applying some options to the agent configuration file (_whatap.conf_). It includes basic configuration, configuration for server connection and data transfer, how to manage the configuration files for multiple application servers, and transaction tracing, and more. For more information, see [the following](../set-agent).

- **Starting the monitoring**

  After all settings are made, restart the application server. The agent starts collecting data. First, check whether the monitoring data has been collected in <Cmdname sid="side_appDashboard" className="uitext" />. For more information about <Cmdname sid="side_appDashboard" className="uitext" />, see [the following](../dashboard).
