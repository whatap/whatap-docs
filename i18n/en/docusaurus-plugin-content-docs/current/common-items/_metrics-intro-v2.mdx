## What is the metrics?

WhaTap collects data from the monitoring targets and provides them to users. The data collected by the agent is marked with **metrics**. 

<!-- 메트릭스 효용성 안내 -->

**Metrics** provides a baseline for viewing the user environment at a glance. For example, you can easily check the average memory utilization by server and average DB connection time through the list of source data or a visualized chart view. After finding any problem factor, you can see the detailed analysis through logs or traces. 

**Metrics** also helps you scale the user environment. Determining the required amount of resources through the resource usage statistics is important in terms of performance improvement and cost effectiveness.

## WhaTap's metrics elements

WhaTap's **metric** consists of the following components:

-   **_Category_**: It means a key to identify units that bind the related metrics.
-   **_Tags_**: Data containing unique identifiers to find the targets to collect. It stores items such as IP, Oname, and host that rarely change. Multiple tags exist in the form of map.
-   **_Fields_**: It stores all metrics collected from the agent. Multiple fields exist in the form of map.
-   **_Time_**: Time when the metric has been collected.
-   **_Oid_**: Unique number of the agent that has collected metrics.
-   **_Oname_**: Unique name of the agent that has collected metrics.

## Viewing and visualizing the metrics data

WhaTap provides a list of original data collected according to the conditions specified by user and various charts visualized for convenience as follows. See the menus such as **_Metrics Search_** that can look up the original data of metrics, **_Metrics Chart_** that can look up metrics data through visualized charts, and **_Metrics Anomaly Detection_** that can detect out-of-pattern anomalies by comparing with the patterns of metrics learned by AI.
