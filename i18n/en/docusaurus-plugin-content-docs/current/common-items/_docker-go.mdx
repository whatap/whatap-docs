This process applies the WhaTap monitoring agent to the Go application running on the Docker container and packages the container image as follows.

## Download agent

Install the whatap-agent package when building your Go application docker image.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="x64" label="x64" default>

```docker title='x64'
RUN wget https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/repo.whatap.io/alpine/x86_64/whatap-agent.tar.gz
RUN tar -xvzf whatap-agent.tar.gz -C /
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="aarch64" label="AArch64" default>

```docker title='AArch64'
RUN wget https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/repo.whatap.io/alpine/aarch64/whatap-agent.tar.gz
RUN tar -xvzf whatap-agent.tar.gz -C /
```

## Agent CONFIG.

Create the _whatap.conf_ file in which WhaTap's access key and server IP address have been set in the user application execution path. If you use a specific path, you can set it with the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable.

```docker title='whatap.conf'
RUN echo "accesskey={Access Key}" >> whatap.conf 
RUN echo "whatap.server.host={Collection Server IP Address}" >> whatap.conf
```

:::note 

Be careful not to expose the **access key** to images that are in Docker Public status.

:::

### Setting the `WHATAP_HOME` variable

You can set the _whatap.conf_ path as the `WHATAP_HOME` variable. Create the `WHATAP_HOME` path first. Add the `WHATAP_HOME` setting before the application startup command. 

```bash
mkdir ./whatap_home
echo "license={Access Key}" >> ./whatap_home/whatap.conf
echo "whatap.server.host={Collection Server IP Address}" >> ./whatap_home/whatap.conf

# run application
WHATAP_HOME=./whatap_home ./app
```

## Configuring the Go library

Add the [github.com/whatap/go-api](https://github.com/whatap/go-api) package to the Go application source code.

```bash
go get github.com/whatap/go-api
```

Configure for initialization and shutdown with the `trace.Init()` and `trace.Shutdown()` functions. Set the startup and end for transactions with the `trace.Start()` and `trace.End()` functions.

```go title='Go'
import "github.com/whatap/go-api/trace"

func main(){
    trace.Init(nil)
    //It must be executed before closing the app.    
    defer trace.Shutdown()    

    ctx, _ := trace.Start(context.Background(), "Start Tx")

    ...

    trace.End(ctx, err)
}
```

## Configuring the container environment variables

After building Docker, set **container environment variables** in the Kubernetes environment. Add the following items in the _yaml_ file for releasing the application. 

```yaml
env:
- name: NODE_IP
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
```

See the following example: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: # Pod Name
  labels: # Pod Labels
spec:
  containers:
    env:
    - name: NODE_IP
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
    - name: NODE_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
```

:::note 

**Roles of environment variables**

- `NODE_IP`: Collects the IP address of the node where the current Pod has been hosted.

- `NODE_NAME`: Collects the name of the node where the current Pod is running.

- `POD_NAME`: Collects the name of the current Pod.

## Running the agent

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cm" label="Command" default>

Add the whatap-agent startup command before the application startup command. 

```docker
sh -c "/usr/whatap/agent/whatap-agent start && [application startup command]"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sup" label="Supervisor" default>

In case of starting the application as supervisor, see the following code to add the whatap-agent service.

```docker
RUN echo "[program:whatap-agent]" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "command = sh -c ‘/usr/whatap/agent/whatap-agent start’" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "user = root" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "startsecs = 0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "autostart = true" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "autorestart = false" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stdout_logfile = /dev/stdout" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stderr_logfile = /dev/stderr" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Execute the following command to check whether the WhaTap service has been run normally. When the application server runs, it begins collecting monitoring information.

```docker
ps -ef | grep whatap_agent
```

## Checking the agent installation

To check whether the agent has been installed, go to <Cmdname sid="dashboard" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="serviceDashboard" className="uitext" />.

If you have manually installed the downloaded file but cannot see the agent in <Cmdname sid="dashboard" className="uitext" />, check the following.

- Execute the command, `ps -ef | grep whatap_agent` in the container, and then check whether the agent options have been applied properly.

- Check the _`WHATAP_HOME`/logs_ of the container or the _logs_ directory of the application execution path. The file name of the agent log is displayed as _logs/`{boot or install}`-yyyymmdd.log_.
