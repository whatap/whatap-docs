## Filtering the searched results

In the chart area of ​​<Cmdname sid="transaction_map" />, you can distinguish the results by selecting Total, Error, and Read phrases in the upper right corner.

**_Total_**: Displays total transactions

**_Error_**: Only the transactions in which errors occurred, are displayed.

**_Read_**: The number of transactions read from the server is displayed.

For example, if you select an error and then drag a transaction on the chart, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" /> window appears to display a list of erroneous transactions. 
To view all transactions, click **_Total_**.
