You can view the status of heap occupied objects (sizes for each object in heap memory) in the memory of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It retrieves the pure size of the object. Through the <Cmdname sid="count" className="uitext" /> column, it is easy to check the number of main objects. 

#### JVM Option

import Jvm from "../common-items/_import_instance-performance-jvm.mdx";

<Jvm />

:::note 

Because it retrieves the number of objects that are kept until GC, they appear in the list even if they are not actually used. For an accurate query, it is recommended running ***System GC*** and then checking the list. For more information about ***System GC***, see [the following](#side_systemGarbageCollection).
