3. Enter the desired values for filtering. For filtering, enter all values for the filter key, operators, and values. If there are any filters that have not been entered yet, searching is not possible.

4. Aftering entering all filters, click ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png). 

It updates the filtered data in the **_Top 30_** list and the <Cmdname sid="transaction_map" className="uitext" /> chart.

:::note

- You can perform filtering by setting multiple conditions. Added conditions are applied based on `&&`. For example, if the transaction is `/account/save/employee/seoul` and the elapsed time is more than 3 seconds, you can apply as follows:

  > `Transaction` `=` `/account/save/employee/seoul` `Elapsed time (ms)` `>=` `3`
