## In case transactions do not appear in the response time distribution chart

The CPU and memory graphs appear but the response time distribution chart (hitmap) does not appear in the following cases: 

- The agent is connected to the collection server but the tracer is not applied to the PHP extension module.
- Apache and PHP-FPM have not been restarted after configuration.

1. Check whether the PHP extension module has been applied.

   ```bash
   $ sudo php -m

   [PHP Modules]
   bz2
   calendar
   Core
   ctype
   curl
   date
   …
   whatap               # Check the WhaTap module load
   …
   [Zend Modules]
   ```

2. Restart Apache and PHP-FPM services.

3. If the PHP extension module has not been applied, it indicates abnormal installation. Check whether the path of _whatap.so_ or _whatap.ini_ meets the PHP environment.

   With referring to the following guide, check the items like [PHP command (CLI) path](#check-php-cli-path), [PHP extension module path](#check-php-extension-module), and [Additional PHP ini configuration file path](#php-ini-path).
