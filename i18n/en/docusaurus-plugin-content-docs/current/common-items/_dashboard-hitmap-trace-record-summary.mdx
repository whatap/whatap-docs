- The collected data may differ depending on the application type, settings, and step type. **Container** entries appear only when the application is running in the container environment.

- Error related items are displayed when an error occurs from the transaction.

- Some transaction properties provide statistical features. If you select the![Statistics icon](/img/ic-static.svg) button, a window appears where you can see the status of transactions occurred during the query time through a time series chart. If you select a bar graph in the chart, you can go to the <Cmdname sid="side_analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_txSearch" className="uitext" /> menu to view details.

- WhaTap basically stores the client-related information. For more information about the agent settings for user data collection, see [the following](agent-number-of-user).
