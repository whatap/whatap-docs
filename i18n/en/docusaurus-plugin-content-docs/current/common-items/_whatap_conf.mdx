## Configuring the whatap.conf file

### Entry of basic information

Go to the unzipped `$WHATAP_HOME` path. Enter the access key and data collection server's IP address in the _$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf_ file. Go to the [WhaTap monitoring service](https://service.whatap.io) screen and then copy and paste the **access key** and **collection server IP address** from the <Cmdname sid="JAVA-agent-setup-1-subject" className="uitext" /> item of the <Cmdname sid="agent-setup-guide" className="uitext" /> section.

```ini title=$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf
license={access key}
whatap.server.host={collection server IP}
```

:::note

For more information about _whatap.conf_, see [the following](set-agent).

### Setting the security key {#security}

Set a security key to query SQL variables and perform HTTP queries, or use the Thread stop function.

- Java Agent 2.2.2 or later

  After creating the _security.conf_ file in the `$WHATAP_HOME` path, enter a 6-character password consisting of alphabets and numbers as follows:

  ```ini title='security.conf'
  paramkey=ABCDEF # SQL variable and HTTP query lookup
  threadkill=ABCDEF # Thread stop function
  ```

- Java agent 2.2.2 or earlier

  After creating the _paramkey.txt_ file in the `$WHATAP_HOME` path, enter a 6-character password consisting of alphabets and numbers as follows:

  ```ini title='paramkey.txt'
  ABCDEF # SQL variable and HTTP query lookup, thread stop function
  ```

:::tip

When updating the Java agent version to 2.2.2, the key values in the existing _paramkey.txt_ file are automatically applied to the _security.conf_ file. For example, if you used `FEDCBA` in _paramkey.txt_ and updated to the version 2.2.2, it is applied to the _security.conf_ file as follows:

```ini
paramkey=FEDCBA
threadkill=FEDCBA
```

If the _paramkey.txt_ file does not exist, the key value of the _security.conf_ file is automatically created as the key value of **WHATAP**.
