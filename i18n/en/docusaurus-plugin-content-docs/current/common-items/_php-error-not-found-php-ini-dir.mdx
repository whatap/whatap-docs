## Error: Not found PHP ini directory

This error occurs when the value in `Scan this dir for additional.ini files` has not been checked. If the PHP compile installation option, `--with-config-file-scan-dir=PATH` has not been installed, the environment information does not exist. 

After referring to the following guide, check the correct [PHP command (CLI) location](#check-php-cli-path) and then proceed with [Optional installation of the PHP extension module and whatap-php service](#extension-modul-manual-setting).

```bash
$ sudo php -i | grep '.ini files'

Scan this dir for additional .ini files => (none)
```
