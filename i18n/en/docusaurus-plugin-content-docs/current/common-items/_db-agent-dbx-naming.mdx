-   **object_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `{type}`-`{ip2}`-`{ip3}`-`{port}`

    It is an agent naming (ONAME) scheme to identify database servers. An OID is created based on the ONAME.

    | Configuration       | Description                                                                      |
    | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | {type}              | Use the value set in `whatap.app_name`.                                          |
    | {ip0}               | The first byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **10** in **10**.11.12.13)     |
    | {ip1}               | The second byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **11** in 10.**11**.12.13)    |
    | {ip2}               | The third byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **12** in 10.11.**12**.13)     |
    | {ip3}               | The fourth byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **13** in 10.11.12.**13**)    |
    | {port}              | Database server port                                                             |
    | {hostname}          | Host name                                                                        |

-   **auto_oname_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    The function to automatically obtain the agent name (oname) from the server is activated. Upon application, the options for `-Dwhatap.name` and `-Dwhatap.oname` are ignored. It obtains `oname` through communication with the collection server and then starts the agent's normal operation.

-   **auto_oname_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `agent`

    When an agent name is automatically granted from the server, the prefix of the agent name (business name as usual) is used. The prefix + serial number (from 1) is assigned.

-   **auto_oname_reset** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    Modify it to obtain a new agent name from the server. If the agent name is automatically granted, the system environment variable, `whatap.oname` is set. Once set, the system environment variables are not changed until the Java instance is restarted. For a reset, modify the value of `auto_oname_reset`. If you change it to a value different from the current setting, it is to be applied.
