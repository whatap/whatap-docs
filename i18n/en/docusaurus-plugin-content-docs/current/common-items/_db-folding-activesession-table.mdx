### Zooming in the graph chart section

If the current screen is small and difficult to check the widgets, you can see the graph chart widget on a wider screen. Select ![Down arrow icon](/img/ic-caret-down.svg) at the bottom of the <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> section. The <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> section is collapsed and the graph chart widget section is expanded.

To zoom out the graph chart widget, select ![Up arrow icon](/img/ic-caret-up.svg) at the bottom of the <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> section.
