## Viewing the past data

The dashboard basically provides the real-time monitoring feature but the past data can be viewed using the time selector at the top of the screen. In the time selector, select ![Pause icon](/img/ico-pause.svg) and then set the following time. It updates the data in widgets placed on the dashboard based on the set time.
