By uploading the Linux system logs in real time, you can check the logs generated upon failure. The log files to collect are as follows:

- _/var/log/syslog_
- _/var/log/messages_

The configuration is as follows:

```bash title='Linux Shell'
echo "systemlog.enabled=true" |sudo tee -a /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
```
