- **Cache Hit Ratio** (Buffer Manager.Buffer cache hit ratio)

  It is the percentage of pages that SQL Server found in the memory buffer pool without reading data from disk. A higher value indicates better performance, while a lower value may indicate insufficient memory capacity or buffer pool management issues. Typically, it is recommended to maintain this value at 90% or more.

- **Page Life Expectancy** (Buffer Manager.Page life expectancy)

  It displays the average time in seconds that data pages remain in the buffer pool. The longer the data stays in the buffer pool, the more it is read from memory, reducing the disk I/O and improving the performance. If this value is lower, it indicates that the memory is insufficient or the workload is increased, and the recommended value is 300 seconds (5 minutes) or more. If it is consistently low, you have to consider adding memory.

- **Full Scans/sec**

  It is the number of tables or index scans performed per second. A high value may indicate the need for query optimization or appropriate index designing, because full scan is less efficient than index scan that reads only the required data. Frequent full scans may cause increased CPU usage and decreased performance.

- **Page Lookups/sec** (Buffer Manager.Page lookups/sec)

  It is the number of requests to find pages in the buffer pool. A higher value indicates that more data is being processed, possibly indicating large query executions or table scans. If the value is unusually high, check for missing indexes and poor query design. It may be linked to increased CPU usage.

- **Page Reads/sec** (Buffer Manager.Page reads/sec)

  It is the number of pages per second physically read from disk across all databases. A high value may result in high disk I/O, which may cause performance degradation. Consider increasing the data cache size or reviewing query tuning and index optimization for improvement. Actual read operations on the disk can be costly, so caution is required.

- **Page Writes/sec** (Buffer Manager.Page writes/sec)

  It is the number of database pages physically written to disk per second. If write operations are frequent, it may be due to a high transaction load or bulk data input. If you have a lot of data write operations, you may experience I/O bottlenecks. Accordingly, consider splitting transactions, improving disk performance, and adjusting the log file size.

<InDoc product="cubrid">

- **Logical Reads** (num_data_page_fetches)

  Number of data pages retrieved from memory. Databases often look up data in memory before reading it from disk. This metric plays an important role in evaluating the efficiency of the database by using caches or buffers. A higher value indicates that more data is fetched from memory, which helps reduce disk I/O burden.

- **Pysical Reads** (num_data_page_ioreads)

  Number of data pages read from disk. A higher value indicates that more data is being read from disk instead of memory. This may negatively affect the system performance. It is important to optimize this value as higher values ​​can result in lower hit rates for the database and slower I/O performance.

- **Executions** (executions)

- **Buffer Hit Ratio(%)** (data_page_buffer_hit_ratio)

  This metric represents the hit rate of the data page buffer as a percentage. A higher hit rate indicates that data is being retrieved from the memory buffer quickly, which helps improve the system performance. On the contrary, a low hit rate can result in increased physical I/O, which can lead to poor performance.

  :::note

  Calculation method: ((`Num_data_page_fetches` - `Num_data_page_ioreads`) / `Num_data_page_fetches`) \* 100

  :::

- **Disk Sorts** (num_sort_io_pages)

  Number of pages fetched while performing sort operation on disk. Disk sorting indicates a sorting operation that has not been processed in memory, and a higher value may result in poor performance. You may need to adjust the memory size or sorting strategy to increase the number of sorts that can be processed in memory.

- **CAS Memory size** (psize)

  Size of memory being used by the `cub_cas` (CUBRID Application Server) process. This value indicates the amount of memory occupied by the CUBRID broker (CAS) process, and displays the sum when multiple brokers are running. An abnormal high memory usage may indicate a memory leak or system under stress.

- **CAS count** (broker_count)

  Number of `cub_cas` (CUBRID Application Server) processes running. This value is the number of broker processes. The more brokers there are, the more requests can be processed in parallel. However, as the number of brokers increases, resource consumption also rises, so proper configuration is required.

- **Replication Delay** (time_ha_replication_delay)

  It displays the replication delay time in seconds in the CUBRID's High Availability (HA) environment. This metric measures the time taken for data to be synchronized from the Primary server to the Replica server. A higher value indicates that there is a delay in data synchronization. If replication delay persists, it can affect the system availability and data consistency.

- **Total Hit Ratio(%)** (`total_hit_ratio`)

  It is the ratio of logical reads to physical reads for all data and index reads. It is a key metric for evaluating the caching efficiency of the entire database. It can be used to analyze the overall caching performance of the database operating environment and to prioritize tuning.
