## Avoiding a large number of alerts

When numerous alerts occur, it temporarily stops notifying alerts for a set period. In **_Alert_** > **_Notification Setting_**, go to the Avoids a large number of alerts section.

-   This function can be enabled or disabled by selecting the **_Enable_** toggle button.
-   If the events occur more than **_Number of detections_** during **_Detection time_**, it stops alert notification for **_Pause time_**.

For example, alert notification stops for 5 minutes when 20 events occur within 5 minutes. If the set **_pause time_** elapses, the Avoids a large number of alerts function is disabled.
