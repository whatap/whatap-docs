{/* 이를 통해 Java 애플리케이션의 성능 문제를 진단하는데 이용할 수 있습니다. * <Cmdname sid="status" className="uitext" />: You can check the current status of the thread. It can be used to diagnose the performance issues in Java applications.  \*/}

It can provide snapshot information of all threads in the Java process. <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" /> is a key menu for CPU optimization. You can manage CPU resources more finely by checking the status at the thread level rather than the process level. For example, you can identify performance issues by checking the thread that is using the most CPU at the time of query and then checking the stack information for the thread.

- Thread status: You can see the **Number of all threads** and the number of threads in <span class='snormal'>RUNNABLE</span> and <span class='loger'>WAITING</span> status through the status summary at the top of the list.

- <Cmdname sid="thread_dump" className="uitext" />: You can create a full thread dump by clicking <code class='my'>Thread Dump</code> on the upper right. After generating a full thread dump, you can check the information at the bottom of the thread list.

- Individual thread dump: You can see individual thread dump information by selecting the ![Expand icon](/img/ico-expander.svg) icon for each thread. You can view the details and stack traces about the thread state and execution path, in <Cmdname sid="stack" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="stack_trace" className="uitext" />. ![Refresh icon](/img/ico-refresh.png) The list can be checked after refreshing it. For more information, see [the following](#thread-details).

- In <Cmdname sid="thread_cpu_time" className="uitext" />: It indicates the total accumulated time that the thread has occupied the CPU. It uses the time in milliseconds.

- <Cmdname sid="TTL08126" className="uitext" />: If you click the ![Refresh icon](/img/ico-refresh.png) Refresh icon at the top of the thread list, the difference between the CPU time of the existing thread and the CPU time of the current thread is added.

:::tip

<Cmdname sid="thread_cpu_time" className="uitext" /> is the total accumulated time that the thread has occupied the CPU. Therefore, to identify the thread that is using the most CPU at the query time, it is required to check the <Cmdname sid="TTL08126" className="uitext" /> value. For more information, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-instance-performance-analysis#advanced-use-thread-list-dump).

:::note 

**CPU usage spike types**

- Heap memory is full: CPU usage spikes due to frequent GC. 

- There are lots of requests: CPU usage spikes due to processing a large number of client requests. 

- Wrong code logic: Inefficient algorithms or infinite loops can cause spikes in CPU usage.

### Analyzing the thread dump {#thread-details}

It guides you to individual thread dumps that can be checked in <Cmdname sid="thread_list" className="uitext" />.

{/* <ScrollToLink anchor='thread-details' /> */}

#### JVM Option

To use the <Cmdname sid="thread_dump" className="uitext" /> feature for each Java version, additional configuration for JVM options is required.

import Jvm from "../common-items/_import_instance-performance-jvm.mdx";

<Jvm />

#### Thread status {#stateofthread}

The states of the thread are declared as enumerated types named `State` in the `java.lang.Thread` class.

- `NEW`: The thread has been generated but not run.

- `RUNNABLE`: The CPU has been occupied and the tasks are being performed. The resource allocation by the OS may result in `WAITING` state.

- `WAITING`: It is waiting using the `wait()`, `join()`, and `park()` methods.

- `TIMED_WAITING`: It is waiting using the `sleep()`, `wait()`, `join()`, and `park()` methods. The difference from the `WAITING` state is that it is waiting for a given time. The waiting state can be released by the time as well as external environment change.

- `BLOCKED`: It is waiting for the locked object to be released.

- `TERMINATED`: Execution has been completed.

#### Thread dump information

You can check individual thread dumps by selecting the <LinkImage img="ico-expander-black.svg" className="ico black" /> button for each thread in the thread list.
