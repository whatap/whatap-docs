Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt; <UI>RAC Monitoring</UI>

***RAC Monitoring*** is configured to allow monitoring of databases formed as a cluster in Oracle Database. The default presets provided in the ***RAC Monitoring*** menu are optimized for the monitoring. The edit role is required to save, delete, and change the presets.

You can compare and analyze key performance metrics occurring in each instance at a glance. You can effectively perform monitoring by aggregating data such as the number of agents running, the sum of all active sessions, and the number of transactions. Users can easily check the changes in metric values ​​over time and high performance metrics for each instance through graph charts.

Additionally, users can see the longest-lasting active sessions, which can be used as a basis for diagnosing and resolving the system performance bottlenecks.
