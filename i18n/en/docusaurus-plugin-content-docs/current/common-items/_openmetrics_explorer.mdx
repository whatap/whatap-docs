**OpenMetrics Explorer** is a feature that allows you to directly explore custom metrics based on Prometheus using PromQL, visualize them in various formats, and check metric states or gain insights.

With this feature, you can freely query the metrics you need, extract meaningful data, or connect them to dashboards for continuous monitoring.

:::note

To use OpenMetrics Explorer, you must install the Open Agent.

* See [Install WhaTap Operator](../kubernetes/install-whatap-operator).

#### Graph

* **Line**: Default time-series line chart  
* **Bar**: Visualizes values as a bar chart  
* **StackBar**: Stacked bar chart that shows accumulated values  

#### Table / Raw

* **Table**: Displays time-series values in chronological order as a table  
* **Raw**: View the Prometheus API response directly in JSON format  

### PromQL Syntax Support and Autocomplete

When you enter metrics such as `node_cpu_seconds_total` or `container_memory_usage_bytes`, the autocomplete feature suggests available metrics and operators.  

It also supports label filtering in the form `{pod="example"}`.

## Adding to Dashboard

You can save a queried PromQL as a dashboard widget and continuously monitor the desired metrics.

### How to Add

1. In the **OpenMetrics Explorer** screen, click the **+ Add to Dashboard** button in the upper right corner.  
2. In the **Add to Dashboard** window, select an existing dashboard or create a new one.  
3. Click **Apply** to add the widget to the chosen dashboard.  

    * You can enter a widget name and description in the added dashboard.  
    * Added widgets can be freely repositioned in the Flexboard grid layout and edited with PromQL.
