## Viewing the past data

<Cmdname sid="transaction_map" className="uitext" /> provides the real-time monitoring by default. By default, the data can be viewed in real time for 5 minutes. Click the green button in the time selector to select a desired lookup time.

To view the historical data, click ![Pause icon](/img/ico-pause.svg) in the time selector. It changes to period viewing mode and you can view the transaction data for up to 1hour. The chart data of <Cmdname sid="transaction_map" className="uitext" /> based on the date and time set by the user is refreshed.

You can stop the query at any time while searching the past data.
    _ To change the filters, first stop the query, and then change the filters.
    _ If you press the Search button again without changing the filters, it continues searching from where it was stopped.

To switch to the Realtime mode after a historical inquiry, click ![Playback icon](/img/ico-play-time.svg).

:::note

- The range of the historical inquiries may differ depending on the transaction volume.
