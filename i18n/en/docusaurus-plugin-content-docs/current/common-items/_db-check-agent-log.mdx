## Checking the agent installation

Run the _start.sh_ shell script file or the _start.bat_ batch file from the installation path of the database agent. When you run the agent, it starts collecting monitoring data from the database. If the WhaTap logo is displayed in the terminal after executing the shell script, it is normally executed.

```bash title='start.sh'
$ ./start.sh

Just Tap, Always Monitoring

:::note

To use it like a daemon, execute the `startd.sh` command. However, it works only in the environment where **nohup** has been installed.
