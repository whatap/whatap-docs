| `Bytes_received`                    | -     | If `bytes` and `Bytes_received` of the DB server are high, it indicates that this server is a write-oriented server (e.g. insert).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | MySQL Resource |
| `Bytes_sent`                        | -     | If `bytes` and `Bytes_sent` from the DB server are high, it indicates that this server is a read-oriented (select) server. If you apply it together with `Questions` and `Uptime`, the average bytes per query and the processing bytes per hour can be counted.                                                                                                                                                                                              | MySQL Resource |
| `Created_tmp_disk_tables`           | -     | Number of temporary tables on disk created by the server while executing commands.

| `Created_tmp_tables`                | -     | Number of internal temporary tables created by the server while executing commands. Temporary tables can be used in a few cases, typically when using UNION ALL in a query or when using ORDER BY, GROUP BY, or DISTINCT. It is recommended that the number of temporary tables on disk (`Created_tmp_disk_tables`) is not high (less than 10%) relative to the total number of internal temporary tables (`Created_tmp_disk_tables` + `Created_tmp_tables`). | MySQL Resource |
