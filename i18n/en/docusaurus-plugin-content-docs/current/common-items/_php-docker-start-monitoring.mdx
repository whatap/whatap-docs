## Starting the application monitoring

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cm" label="Command" default>

Add the whatap-php service startup command before the application startup command. 

```docker title='Red Hat/CentOS, Debian/Ubuntu, Amazon Linux'
sh -c "/etc/init.d/whatap-php start && [application startup command]"
```

```docker title='Alpine Linux'
sh -c "/usr/whatap/php/whatap-php start && [application startup command]"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sup" label="Supervisor" default>

In case of starting the application as supervisor, see the following code to add the whatap-php service.

```docker

RUN echo "[program:whatap-php]" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "command = /etc/init.d/whatap-php start" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "user = root" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "autostart = true" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "autorestart = true" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stdout_logfile = /dev/stdout" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stderr_logfile = /dev/stderr" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Execute the following command to check whether the WhaTap service has been run normally. 

```docker

ps -ef | grep whatap_php

```

## Checking the agent installation

To check whether the agent has been installed, go to <Cmdname sid="dashboard" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="serviceDashboard" className="uitext" />.

If you have manually installed the downloaded file but cannot see the agent in <Cmdname sid="dashboard" className="uitext" />, check the following.

-   Execute the command, `ps -ef | grep whatap` in the container, and then check whether the agent options have been applied properly.

-   Check the content of the container in the _/usr/whatap/php/logs_ path. The file name of the agent log is displayed as _logs/`{boot or install}`-yyyymmdd.log_.
