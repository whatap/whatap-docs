When a filter is applied, the logs that match the specified conditions are filtered. You can enter multiple filters. If the filter has the same tag, it is applied as OR (||). Otherwise, it is applied as AND (&&).

You can specify a filter by directly entering a value in the input field or clicking the **_Filter_** field. Filter tags are entered in the following order: `Search key`, `Operator`, and `Search value`. When entering values in the input field, separate keywords with spaces. If spaces are included for keywords, enclose them with the _''_ or _""_ symbol. If the symbol-enclosed keyword includes _\\_, enter it as _\\\\_. If you select ![Search icon](/img/ic-search-on-press.svg) **_Search_**, the data with the filter applied can be viewed in the ![number-s3](/img/number-03.png) area.
