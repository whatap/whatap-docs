## Request Data

-   If the scroll reaches the bottom, the next data is retrieved.

-   In ![number-s](/img/number-01.png), specify the **_time_** and collection unit, **_category_**, of the log data to be searched.

-   If the **_category_** is changed, the logs that correspond to the selected category are searched. You can see the logs in ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) bar chart and ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) log table.

-   If you click a bar in ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) bar chart, the logs are viewed that correspond to the time range of the bar. 

-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) You can see the total number of logs viewed from the upper left of the log table. 

-   On the upper right of the ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) log table, select the <LinkImage img='ic-fullscreen.svg' desc='전체 화면 아이콘'/> **_full screen_** icon, you can see the **_log_** and **_timestamp_** in the full screen.

-   ![number-s](/img/number-04.png) In Side menu, you can see the logs filtered by tags. Up to two search keys can be selected, and multiple search values can be selected.

## Checking the log content

{@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-log-content.mdx} 

-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) For each row (log) of the log table, the ![Icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg) **_More_** button exists. If you select the ![Icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg) **_More_** button, you can check the entire content of the log like ![number-s](/img/number-05.png).

## Viewing the logs with a chart

<ImgLang img='log-trend.png' desc='로그 트렌드 바 차트 sc'/>

-   You can click a ![icon](/img/char-a.svg) desired time on the bar chart to view the logs in the period of time.

-   You can use the ![b icon](/img/char-b.svg) time selection option on the upper left of the log table under the bar chart to further refine your log search in the selected time zone:

    -   1min: interval (spacing between bars on the chart)

    -   Select a time option: Time zone whose time range is divided into 6 segments
