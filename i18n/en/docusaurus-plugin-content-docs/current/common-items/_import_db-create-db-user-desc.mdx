- **Redis 6 or earlier**: The <em>uid.sh</em> shell script file (or <em>uid.bat</em> batch file) can be found in the path where the WhaTap's database agent has been installed. When only the password exists without username, set <code>DB_USER</code> as <code>""</code>. e.g. `./uid.sh "" whatap\!pwd`

- **Redis 6 or later**: The <em>uid.sh</em> shell script file (or <em>uid.bat</em> batch file) can be found in the path where the WhaTap database agent has been installed. If there is only a password without username, set <code>DB_USER</code> as <code>default</code>. e.g. `./uid.sh default whatap\!pwd`
