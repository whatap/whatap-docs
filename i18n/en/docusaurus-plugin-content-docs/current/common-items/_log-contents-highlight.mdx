| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `a b c`               | Separate each keyword with a space.                                   | a, b, c          |
| `"Whatap is good."`   | To include spaces in keywords, wrap them in '`'` or `""`.             | Whatap is good.  |
| `"Whatap\\ is good."` | If `\` is included in the keyword surrounded by "", enter it as `\\`. | Whatap\ is good. |
