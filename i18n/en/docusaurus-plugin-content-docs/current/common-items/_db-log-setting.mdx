WhaTap provides the database log monitoring service. You can collect logs from server-installed databases and AWS RDS that is a cloud service. Through this, you can check the scattered logs in the database at a glance in **_Live Tail_** and **_Log Trend_** for log monitoring.

:::tip

After log monitoring has been applied, installed DB is displayed as `#DB`, AWS RDS as `#RDS_LOG`, and `#RDS_EVENT` in **_Category_** of each menu and the log list.

## Applying to the server-installed DB

To monitor logs in server-installed databases, apply the following options in _xos.conf_ file.

<InDoc product='mysql'>

```ini title='xos.conf'
file=/var/log/mysqld.log
file1=/var/log/mysql_history.log
file2=/var/lib/mysql/dbx-database-slow.log
```

</InDoc>

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

```ini title='xos.conf'
file=/opt/postgresql/logs/postgresql.log
file1=/opt/postgresql/data/logs/pg10/postgresql-Sun.log
file2=/opt/postgresql/data/logs/pg10/postgresql-Mon.log
file3=/opt/postgresql/data/logs/pg10/postgresql-Tue.log
```

## Applying to the AWS RDS logs

### Configuration for monitoring AWS RDS logs

![AWS RDS Log](/img/aws-rds-log-diagram.png)

AWS provides various information for RDS monitoring. To check information, directly access the AWS console. However, WhaTap's **AWS RDS Log** provides logs and events from RDS in **_Log_** under Database Monitoring.

WhaTap's **AWS RDS Log** can be installed through **AWS CloudFormation**. For more information about **AWS CloudFormation**, see [the following link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ko_kr/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html).

### Checking the roles

To install WhaTap's **AWS RDS Log** via **AWS CloudFormation**, first check the required IAM roles.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudformation:CreateStack",
        "cloudformation:UpdateStack",
        "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
