## Dead lock

Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_deadLock" className="uitext" />

A deadlock occurs when multiple processes or transactions block each other from processing by locking database resources (tables or rows). Frequent deadlocks cause inconvenience to end users and reduce the service quality. In the <Cmdname sid="side_deadLock" className="uitext" /> menu, you can see the time and related data when the deadlock occurred. This information can help you identify and solve problems in the application design.

You can check information about deadlocks that have occurred in the database.

1. Set the time to search in <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" />.

2. Select an instance name to view in <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" />.

3. Select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png).

It provides deadlock information in the form of table.

:::note

- The query time can be set up to 3 weeks.

- For more information on how to use the <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" /> option, see [the following](usage-ui#timeselector).

## Deadlock Collection

### Collection Method

The agent periodically runs the `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` command to collect deadlock information. Due to the nature of this command, only the **most recent deadlock** can be retrieved. If the collected information is identical to the previous one, it is not stored again.

### Collection Interval

By default, **information is collected every hour**. You can change this interval with the following agent option:

- **deadlock_interval** (Int)  
  Default: `60` (unit: minutes)  
  Sets the interval for collecting deadlock information. Only **the last deadlock that occurred during the interval** is collected.

:::note

For more details on data collection settings, see the [following](https://docs.whatap.io/mysql/agent-dbx-settings#%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%84%B0-%EC%88%98%EC%A7%91).

### Alarm Settings

You can configure alerts for deadlock occurrences. However, since deadlock data is checked at the `deadlock_interval`, **alerts are not triggered in real time** but are sent based on deadlocks detected at each interval.
