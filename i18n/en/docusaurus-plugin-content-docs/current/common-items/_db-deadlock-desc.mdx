## Dead lock

Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_deadlock" className="uitext" />

A deadlock occurs when multiple processes or transactions block each other from processing by locking database resources (tables or rows). Frequent deadlocks cause inconvenience to end users and reduce the service quality. In the <Cmdname sid="side_deadlock" className="uitext" /> menu, you can see the time and related data when the deadlock occurred. This information can help you identify and solve problems in the application design.
