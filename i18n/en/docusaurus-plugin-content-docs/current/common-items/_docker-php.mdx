This process applies the WhaTap monitoring agent to the PHP application running on the Docker container and packages the container image as follows.

EKS Fargate is to be supported later.

## Download agent

Install the whatap-php package when building your PHP application docker image.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="x64" label="x64" default>

```docker title='x64'
RUN wget https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/repo.whatap.io/alpine/x86_64/whatap-php.tar.gz
RUN tar -xvzf whatap-php.tar.gz -C /
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="aarch64" label="AArch64" default>

```docker title='AArch64'
RUN wget https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/repo.whatap.io/alpine/aarch64/whatap-php.tar.gz
RUN tar -xvzf whatap-php.tar.gz -C /
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Agent CONFIG.

- Use the following command to set the installation script. If you enter the WhaTap access key and server IP, the PHP environment data is automatically collected.

  ```docker
  RUN (echo "[Access Key]"; echo "[Server IP]")|/usr/whatap/php/install.sh
  ```

- Using the following method, you can directly enter the PHP environment settings. 

  ```docker
  # RUN /usr/whatap/php/install.sh -l [Access Key] -s [Server IP] -v [PHP version x.x] -i [php.ini full path] -p [Process Name] -z [thread safety] 
  RUN /usr/whatap/php/install.sh -l xxxxx -s 1.1.1.1/2.2.2.2 -v 7.0 -i /etc/php.ini -p httpd [-z]
  ```

:::note 

Be careful not to expose the **access key** to images that are in Docker Public status.

## Configuring the container environment variables

After building Docker, set **container environment variables** in the Kubernetes environment. Add the following items in the _yaml_ file for releasing the application. 

```yaml

env:
- name: NODE_IP
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}

```

See the following example: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: # Pod Name
  labels: # Pod Labels
spec:
  containers:
    env:
    - name: NODE_IP
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
    - name: NODE_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
```

:::note 

**Roles of environment variables**

- `NODE_IP`: Collects the IP address of the node where the current Pod has been hosted.

- `NODE_NAME`: Collects the name of the node where the current Pod is running.

- `POD_NAME`: Collects the name of the current Pod.

## Running the agent

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cm" label="Command" default>

Add the whatap-php startup command before the application startup command. 

```docker'
sh -c "/usr/whatap/php/whatap-php start && [Application Startup Command]"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sup" label="Supervisor" default>

In case of starting the application as supervisor, see the following code to add the whatap-php service.

```docker

RUN echo "[program:whatap-php]" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "command = sh -c ‘/usr/whatap/php/whatap-php start’" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "user = root" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "startsecs = 0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "autostart = true" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "autorestart = false" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stdout_logfile = /dev/stdout" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stderr_logfile = /dev/stderr" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Execute the following command to check whether the WhaTap service has been run normally. When the application server runs, it begins collecting monitoring information.

```docker

ps -ef | grep whatap_php

```

## Checking the agent installation

To check whether the agent has been installed, go to <Cmdname sid="dashboard" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="serviceDashboard" className="uitext" />.

If you have manually installed the downloaded file but cannot see the agent in <Cmdname sid="dashboard" className="uitext" />, check the following.

- Execute the command, `ps -ef | grep whatap` in the container, and then check whether the agent options have been applied properly.

- Check the content of the container in the _/usr/whatap/php/logs_ path. The file name of the agent log is displayed as _logs/`{boot or install}`-yyyymmdd.log_.
