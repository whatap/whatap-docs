To know the meaning of each metric, select ![Information](/img/ic-info-circle.svg) next to the name or see [the following](metrics-data-list).

- If you stop the **real-time query** mode of the time and click a specific time on the chart in the widget, you can check the session performed at the selected time in the ![Number 4](/img/number-04.png) <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> table. After that, a time bar that allows you to view the data every 5 seconds appears on the <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> table.

  :::note

  - The selected time can be seen on the upper right of the <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> table.

  - In the <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> table list, the text colors are changed black → <span class='slow'>orange</span> → <span class='vslow'>Red</span>, which means that the performance of the session is getting slower.

- After stopping the real-time query mode, you can download the chart data as a CSV file by clicking the ![More icon](/img/ico-more.svg) button on the upper right of the widget.
