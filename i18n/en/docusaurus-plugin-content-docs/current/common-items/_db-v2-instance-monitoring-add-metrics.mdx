### Adding metrics

Multiple metrics can be added in a widget. You can add up to five metrics.

1. Select ![Configuration icon](/img/ico-setting.svg) on the upper right of the widget to add the metrics in.

2. If the **_Metric Select_** window appears, in the ![number 8](/img/number-08.png) metrics list or [number 9](/img/ic-number-09.svg) graph list, select ![Add icon](/img/ico-add.svg) on the right of the metric to add.

3. To add more metrics, repeat the step **2**.

4. To easily identify the widget, change the ![number 6](/img/number-06.png) **_Title_**.

5. Select **_Save_** on the upper right of the screen.

Charts are generated as many times added to the widget to which metrics are added. If you select <span class='mark'>i</span> next to the widget name, you can see the name and description of the added metric. You can also check the figure through a tooltip by hovering your mouse over the chart.
