### Adding metrics

Multiple metrics can be added in a widget. You can add up to four metrics.

1. Select ![More icon](/img/ico-more.svg) on the upper right of the widget to add the metrics in.

2. If the **_Metric Select_** window appears, in the ![number 8](/img/number-08.png) metrics list or ![number 9](/img/ic-number-09.svg) graph list, select ![Add icon](/img/ico-add.svg) on the right of the metric to add.

3. To add more metrics, repeat the step **2**.

4. To easily identify the widget, change the ![number 6](/img/number-06.png) <Cmdname sid="title" className="uitext" />.

5. Select <Cmdname sid="save" className="uitext" /> on the lower right of the screen.

Charts are generated as many times added to the widget to which metrics are added. If you select ![information icon](/img/ic-info-circle.svg) next to the widget name, you can see the name and description of the added metric. You can also check the figure through a tooltip by hovering your mouse over the chart.

The tooltip of the ![Information Icon](/img/ic-info-circle.svg) button is not supported in multiple languages.
