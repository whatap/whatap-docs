## Checking the logs

- _dbx.log_

  All logs related to the agent startup and collection can be found in _`$WHATAP_HOME`/logs/dbx.log_ path. If the size of the _dbx.log_ file exceeds 25 MB, it is backed up with the file name of _dbx.log.[n]_. To clean up files, delete the files starting from the greatest (old) number.

- _xos.log_

  The logs related to the startup of XOS are recorded in _`$XOS installation path`/xos`yymmdd`.log_ file. The logs are created by date.
