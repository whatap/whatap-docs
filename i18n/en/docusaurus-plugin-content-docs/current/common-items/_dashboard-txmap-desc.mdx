The <Cmdname sid="transaction_map" className="uitext" /> chart displays the response times for each completed transaction in the distribution chart form. Same as the hitmap, you can find and analyze problems based on the distribution patterns. <Cmdname sid="hitmap" className="uitext" /> displays the grouped transactions every 5 seconds, but <Cmdname sid="transaction_map" className="uitext" /> displays transactions individually.

**How is it different from the hitmap analysis?**

The hitmap uses the aggregated data to display the overall trend over a long-term period. On the other hand, the transaction map uses individual transactions to check the transaction distribution within a short-term period with no time constraints. It also differs in that it allows users to apply various filters to select only the desired transactions and observe their trends.

- To analyze the distribution of the long-term, high-volume transactions, use the hitmap analysis (<Cmdname sid="analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="hitmap" className="uitext" />).

- To do performance test, or analyze the transaction distribution within 1 to 5 minutes upon a failure, or check the transaction distribution without limiting the execution time, check the <Cmdname sid="transaction_map" className="uitext" />.
