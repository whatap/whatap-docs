<Cmdname sid="side_flexboard" className="uitext" /> is a custom integrated dashboard. You can create a real-time dashboard with the project data such as applications, servers, databases, and containers.

You can quickly complete the initial setup with preconfigured templates and build dashboards in your preferred format. By adding data widgets or modifying properties, you can display information in the form you need, and with filtering functions, you can narrow down monitoring targets. When you set a time range, you can check data from a specific point in time, and by using auxiliary charts, you can analyze data in various ways. Dashboards can be added to favorites for easy access, and personalized dashboards can be copied to other accounts for reuse.
