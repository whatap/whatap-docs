## In case of the application server using the OSGI framework

Register any agent package prefix (whatap) in the JVM options for an OSGI framework-based application server.

The application server is available in Jboss EAP 6.0 or later, Jboss AS 7.0 or later, Wildfly 8.0 or later, IBM WebSphere AS 7.0 or later, and such.

### JBoss AS, Wildfly, JBoss EAP 6.0 or later

Register a prefix in the following file:

```apacheconf title='$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.conf(domain.conf)'
-Djboss.modules.system.pkgs=whatap
```

![JBOSS EAP 7.0](https://img.whatap.io/media/agent_java/install/410.png)

### WebSphere

As an JVM option, add the following.

```bash
-Dcom.ibm.ws.classloader.server.alwaysAllowedPackages=whatap
```

-   If "\*" is specified as the default value, no additional setting is required.
-   For the setting location, see [WebSphere](add-jvm-opt/websphere).

Add the _security.policy_ role as follows:

```java title='$WEBSPHERE_HOME/properties/server.policy 또는 $WEBSPHERE_PROFILE_HOME/properties/server.policy'
grant codeBase "file:$WHATAP_HOME/-"
{
   permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
```
