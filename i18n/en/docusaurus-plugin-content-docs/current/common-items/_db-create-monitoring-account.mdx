## Creating the monitoring account{#uid}

Create an account with roles required for database monitoring. Log in with the root account and then create accounts.

:::note

-   To use the previous accounts, go to [Create DB User File](#create-db-user). If you do not have any permission, you may not be able to proceed with normal monitoring.

-   In the example code, `whatap` is the DB user account name. Change it to your account name.
