- You can classify transactions by each execution section and see them in a diagram. Out of all elapsed times, you can quickly find the times spent for each section and the section that took the longest.

<Xclude product='php,nodejs,golang'>

- If you select each section in the diagram, the corresponding table list appears where the step is located.

- The area where the blue circle (![Active stack icon](/img/ic-c-tx-active-stack.svg)) is located, is the moment when the active stack has been collected. If you select the blue circle, the table list appears where the <Cmdname sid="active_stack" className="uitext" /> button is located. If you click <Cmdname sid="active_stack" className="uitext" />, you can check the step performed during the section.

  :::note

  - In the transaction list, you can see them from the items marked with the ![Active Stack icon](/img/ic-s-active-stack.svg) icon.

  - For more information about active stacks, see [the following](analysis-apm#active-stack).

- ![Column icon](/img/ico-column.svg) <Cmdname sid="select_column" className="uitext" />: You can add or hide the memory accumulation and CPU accumulation data as columns in the table list. The columns are as follows:

  - <UI>No</UI>: Step occurrence sequence

  - <Cmdname sid="TTL06416" className="uitext" />: Start time of each step

  - <Cmdname sid="gap_time" className="uitext" />: The waited time between the start time of the previous step and the current step may have a difference, while there may be a gap from the elapsed time if a delay happens due to external factors.

  - <Cmdname sid="TTL06375" className="uitext" />: Total elapsed time from the start to the end of each method

  - <Cmdname sid="TTL06417" className="uitext" />: Execution details of the step

- ![Download icon](/img/ico-download.svg) <UI>TXT</UI>: You can download basic transaction data and execution data for each section in a text file.

- ![Download icon](/img/ico-download.svg) <UI>SQL</UI>: The basic transaction information and SQL execution data can be downloaded as a text file. <ScrollToLink anchor='downloadsql' />

  - <Cmdname sid="ITM08351" className="uitext" />: It downloads the SQL statistics data after replacing the bind variable value ​​with its original one. If a security key (`paramkey`) is set, the security key input window appears. You must enter the security key for downloading. For more information about the agent configuration related to the security key, see [the following](agent-transaction#profile_http_parameter).

  - <Cmdname sid="ITM08352" className="uitext" />: It downloads SQL statistics data without replacing the bind variable value.

- ![Zoom in icon](/img/ic-outside.svg): You can see only the table list, with hiding the transaction summary and diagrams. If you select ![Zoon out icon](/img/ic-inside.svg), the hidden information reappears. This feature is useful when you have a long list of tables.

- If you select the SQL step, the <UI>SQL</UI> window appears to display parameters. For more information, see [the following](#transaction-parameter).
