-   The time zone for data retrieval can be checked in ![number 4](/img/number-04.png).

-   Active session data is collected every 5 seconds. You can search data for the desired time by selecting the button that moves in 5-second increments on the table.

-   If you select ![Previous time icon](/img/ico-left-time.svg) or ![Next time icon](/img/ico-right-time.svg) on the upper right, you can see the data in 1-minute increments. To move in increments of 5 seconds, select ![5 seconds before icon](/img/ic-caret-left.svg) or ![5 seconds after icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg).

-   In the **_Active Sessions_** table list, the text colors are changed black → <span class='slow'>orange</span> → <span class='vslow'>Red</span>, which means that the performance of the session is getting slower.

-   If you click a specific time point of the graph chart, the (![number 3](/img/number-03.png)) area appears with a red line and the collected active sessions can be also seen.
