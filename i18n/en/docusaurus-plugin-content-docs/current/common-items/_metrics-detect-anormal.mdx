You can compare the patterns of various metrics with the expected patterns learned by the AI. Anomaly detections that deviate from the expected patterns can be viewed through the graph chart. You can check recurring patterns based on the past data and use them to predict future metrics values.

:::note

-   The widgets placed on the screen are not saved and reset when you go to another menu.

-   It is similar to **_Analysis_** > **_Metrics Chart_** except for the pattern and anomaly display.

-   The alert, **Anomaly detection** is based on the **Metric anomaly detection**. For more information about the **Anomaly detection** alert setting, see [the following](set-event-detect-anomal).

## Checking the widgets

-   ![number1](/img/number-01.png) The bright color areas of the graph are the estimated patterns analyzed by the AI. 

-   ![number2](/img/number-02.png) The <span class='normal'>blue</span> graph is the metrics trend of the project.

-   If it deviates from the expected pattern analyzed by the AI, it displays dots on the graph in <span class='slow'>Orange</span> and <span class='vslow'>Red</span> steps. The values that are far from the expected pattern range appear in <span class='vslow'>red</span>.

## Placing the widgets

<ImgLang img='metrics-detect-abnormal-set-widget.png' desc='Metric Anomaly Detection' />

1.  In ![number1](/img/number-01.png) **_Time_**, set a desired time interval. You can set the interval up to 1 month.

2.  In ![number2](/img/number-02.png), select a range of the metrics.

3.  In the following list, select a metric for monitoring.

Place the selected metric to the right of the screen.
