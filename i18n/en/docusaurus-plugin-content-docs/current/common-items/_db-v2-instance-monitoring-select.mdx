### ![](/img/number-01.png) Selecting the lookup time and target

By default, the collected data for the last 10 minutes is retrieved in real time. If you select values in **_Time_** and **_Instance_**, the collected data is automatically applied to the ![number2](/img/number-02.png) graph chart and ![number4](/img/number-04.png) **_active session_** table.

- To view the past data, click the green button and then select the desired lookup time. You can search data up to the last 3 weeks. 

- Select the clock display area to query a random date and time. If you click the text range for date and time, the option appears to select the date and time. To search data in real time again, select ![Real-time icon](/img/ico-play-time.svg).

- To search data from other instances, click **_Instance_** and then select a desired DB server name.
