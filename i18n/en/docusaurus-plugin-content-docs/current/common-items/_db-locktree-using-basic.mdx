Select the desired date, time, and instance to view in ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" /> and ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" />. If a lock occurs at the set time, the searched data appears in **_Lock Wait Sessions_** and the **_Lock Tree_** table at the bottom of the screen.

-   You can see the data for up to two weeks within a chart. If you click a specific time in the graph chart, you can check the lock information for the selected time in the table at the bottom of the screen. If you select the button in seconds, you can view the lock information in 5-second increments.

    :::note

    Through the tags on the upper right of the **_Lock Wait Sessions_** chart, you can see the units to view.

    :::

-   As you continuously drag (drill down) a specific time zone on the graph chart, you can see the charts and lock trees for detailed time zones.

-   You can see the data in 5-second increments by dragging within 3 hours on the chart. However, the data in 5-second increments can only be viewed within the most recent month. The data earlier than one month can only be viewed as 5-minute summary data. For example, you can drag (drill down) lock tree data from 40 days ago for the 5-minute summary data, but you cannot see 5-second data.
