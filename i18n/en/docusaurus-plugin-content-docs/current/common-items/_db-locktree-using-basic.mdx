Set the desired ![number1](/img/number-01.png) date and time, and then select an instance from the ![number2](/img/number-02.png) list. If a lock occurs at the set time, **_lock wait sessions_** and the retrieved data appear in the table at the bottom of the screen.

Select the desired date, time, and instance to view in ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" /> and ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" />. If a lock occurs at the set time, the searched data appears in **_Lock Wait Sessions_** and the **_Lock Tree_** table at the bottom of the screen.

- You can see the data for up to two weeks within a chart. If you click a specific time in the graph chart, you can check the lock information for the selected time in the table at the bottom of the screen. If you select the button in seconds, you can view the lock information in 5-second increments.

  :::note

  Through the tags on the upper right of the **_Lock Wait Sessions_** chart, you can see the units to view.

  :::

- As you continuously drag (drill down) a specific time zone on the graph chart, you can see the charts and lock trees for detailed time zones.

- You can see the data in 5-second increments by dragging within 3 hours on the chart. However, the data in 5-second increments can only be viewed within the most recent month. The data earlier than one month can only be viewed as 5-minute summary data. For example, you can drag (drill down) lock tree data from 40 days ago for the 5-minute summary data, but you cannot see 5-second data.

1. Select the date to view and set the time in <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" /> at the top of the screen.

2. Select an instance to monitor. 

You can check the lock that occurred during the set time on the selected instance.

If any lock occurs during the set period, you can analyze whether locks are concentrated in a specific time period or whether a specific session continuously causes locks in the <UI>Lock Wait Sessions</UI> graph and the table at the bottom.

The **_Lock Wait Sessions_** feature allows you to analyze the lock wait sessions. Depending on the query period, the lock wait session data is provided at 5-minute intervals when the query is for 3 hours or more, and at 5-second intervals when the query is for less than 3 hours. You can also adjust the time range by dragging the chart flexibly.

<Title hashid="1minlocktrend" level={props.level+1}><UI>1-Min Lock Trends</UI></Title>

If you click a specific time zone in **_Lock Wait Sessions_**, the lock occurrence status for 30 minutes, from 15 minutes before to 15 minutes after is visualized. This allows you to effectively analyze the lock occurrence trend at 30-minute intervals. 

:::note 

**_Total Locks_** indicates the total number of locks generated in the time zone.

<Title hashid="selecttimelocktree" level={props.level+1}>Viewing time</Title>

**_1-Min Lock Trends_** and **_Lock Tree_** tables are timed based on the maximum number of locks that occurred at the clicked time in **_Lock Wait Sessions_**. This allows you to find the zone with the most locks. 

![Time viewing 1](/img/db-lock-tree-1-min-lock-trends2.png)

If you click the bar of a different time zone in the **_1-Min Lock Trends_** chart with the **_Lock Wait Sessions_** unchanged, the time range is synced to the **_Lock Tree_** table by using the seconds with the highest number of locks for the minute. This allows you to see the information reflected in the **_Lock Tree_** table when changing the time zone.

![Time viewing 2](/img/db-lock-tree-1-min-lock-trends3.png)

- **Viewing for 3 hours or more** (using 5-minute data)

  The bar color of the 5-minute zone from the time of inquiry appears more prominent. 

  > When the `07:15:00` time point is clicked, the color of the `07:15:00-07:20:00` zone's bar chart appears more prominent.

  ![5-minute pack viewing](/img/db-lock-tree-1-min-lock-trends-5min.png)

- **Viewing for less than 3 hours** (using 5-minute data)

  It is useful for analyzing the locks that occur within short time intervals.
