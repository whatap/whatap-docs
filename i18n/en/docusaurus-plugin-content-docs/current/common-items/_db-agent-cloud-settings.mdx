## Role setting

For the agent to operate normally, set the required roles for each service.

<InDoc product="postgresql,mysql,mssql,oracle">

### AWS Aurora and RDS roles

The Cloud Agent calls the AWS API to perform the following features.

- Check the monitoring targets by querying the AWS Aurora and RDS instance and clusters.
- Collecting CloudWatch metrics

#### IAM inline policy

Add the JSON policy as **inline policy** for IAM user or role. If you are running the agent on EC2, grant the policy to the IAM role associated with the EC2 instance.

- This policy is applied to both **Aurora and RDS services**.
- The resources are configured to apply to all Aurora and RDS resources. If needed, the resource ARNs can be restricted depending on the security policy.
- The agent can use the read-only APIs only. The roles that can affect the database are not included.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "RDSPermissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
        "rds:DescribeDBClusters",
        "rds:DescribeDBClusterParameters",
        "rds:DescribeOptionGroups"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {

### AWS DocumentDB permissions

The cloud agent performs the following features for DocumentDB.

- Viewing the DocumentDB instances and clusters
- Collecting CloudWatch metrics

#### IAM inline policy for DocumentDB

Add the JSON policy as **inline policy** for IAM user or role. If the agent is run on EC2, grant the policy to the IAM role associated with the EC2 instance.

- The resources are configured to apply to all DocumentDB resources. If needed, the resource ARNs can be restricted depending on the security policy.

## Pricing information

:::caution

The Cloud Monitoring Agent is free, but note that separate charges may apply depending on the use of Cloud services.

:::

<InDoc product="postgresql,mongodb,mysql,mssql,oracle">

### AWS Pricing

Cloud monitoring agents are provided without separate SaaS fees, and the monitoring feature can be used simply by installing the agent. However, because the metrics are collected through the API for Cloud services such as AWS CloudWatch, **separate charges may apply depending on the CloudWatch usage**.

This agent basically collects metrics by **calling the GetMetricData API every 1 minute**. Note that the charge may increase depending on the call frequency and collection targets.

For more information about the pricing policy, see the [Amazon CloudWatch pricing in AWS official documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) page.

</InDoc>

<InDoc product="postgresql">

### NCP Pricing

Cloud monitoring agents are provided without separate SaaS fees, and the monitoring feature can be used simply by installing the agent. The Cloud Monitoring Agent calls the Cloud Insight API every 5 minutes to collect metrics at 1-minute granularity.  

The Cloud Insight service of the Naver Cloud Platform (NCP) is currently provided free of charge, but may become paid depending on the future policy. If the Cloud Insight service becomes paid, charges may apply based on the number of API calls. Monitor the usage accordingly.

For more information about the pricing policy, see the [Official pricing guide of NAVER Cloud Platform](https://www.ncloud.com/product/management/cloudInsight#pricing) page.
