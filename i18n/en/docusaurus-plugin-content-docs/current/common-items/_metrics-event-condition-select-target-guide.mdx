## Guide to select generation conditions and targets {#condition-guide}

For the event generation conditions and selection of event targets on metrics alerts, use the same syntaxes. For event generation conditions, use the tag key as a variable. For selection of event targets, use the field key as a variable.

### Basic syntax rules

-   If you just enter a string, it is recognized as a variable. If you enclose it in single quotation marks ('') or double quotation marks (""), it is recognized as text.

    ```java title='oid == "oid"'
    1. oid: variable
    2. ==: function
    3. "oid": text
    ```

    ```java
    // In case oname is ott-1235

    // Normal cases
    onname = 'ott-1235' or onname = "ott-1235"

    // In abnormal cases, notification does not work.
    onname = ott-1235
    ```

-   If you just enter a number, it is recognized as number, and if you enclose it in single quotation marks ('') or double quotation marks (""), it is recognized as text.

    ```java title='oid == 123'
    1. oid: variable
    2. ==: function
    3. 123: number
    ```

    ```java
    // In case oid is 123

    // Normal cases
    oid = 123

    // In abnormal cases, notification does not work.
    id == '123' or oid == "123"
    ```

|    <=         | operand1 <= operand2         | Check whether the operand1 value is less than or equal to the operand2 value.                                         |
|    like        | operand1 like operand2        | Search with patterns whether operand1 includes operand2.                                                              |

|    or          | expression1 or expression2    | Check whether expression1 and expression2 are all `true.`<br/>The operator plays the same role as **||**.             |

#### Usage of like

You can conveniently search for embedded strings via the wildcard (`*`).

-   Searching for strings that start with a specific keyword

    ```java

    Key like "Value*"

    ```

-   Searching for strings that end with a specific keyword

    ```java

    Key like "*Value"

    ```

-   Searching for strings that include a specific keyword

    ```java

    Key like "*Value*"

    ```

-   The wildcard (`*`) cannot be used in the middle of keywords.

    ```java

    // Unsupported syntax
    Key like "Va*lue"

    ```

-   If you omit the wildcard (`*`) in the `like` operator, it operates as equals (`==`).

    ```java

    // The following two statements have the same result.
    Key like "Value"
    Key == "Value"

    ```
