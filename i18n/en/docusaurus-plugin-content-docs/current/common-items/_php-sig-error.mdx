## Segmentation fault, Sig bus error

If any service failure occurs after applying the PHP Monitoring, check the error log for Apache or PHP-FPM.

In the content of the error log, check for any error messages such as `segmentation fault` and `sig bus`. The messages include phrases like `kill child process`, `exit child`, and `exit process`. 

If any error occurs, it can be seen that a conflict happened in the PHP extension module, _whatap.so_. Stop the PHP extension module, _whatap.so_, and then restart Apache or PHP-FPM.

In the environment that does not affect the service, add the `Core dump` setting and then reload _whatap.so_. If any error occurs, the _dump_ file is generated. Analyze the _dump_ file by using gdb for resolving the root cause. 

### Core dump configuration

1. Give permission for the directory to generate the _dump_ file.

   ```java
   chmod 0777 /home/httpd-core
   ```

2. Perform system configuration.

   ```java
   ulimit -c unlimited
   sysctl fs.suid_dumpable=2
   sysctl kernel.core_uses_pid=0
   sysctl kernel.core_pattern='| /home/httpd-core/core-%e.%p'
   ```

### Apache

1. Set the CoreDumpDirectory item in the Apache conf. 

   ```java
   vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

   CoreDumpDirectory /home/httpd-core
   ```

2. Restart Apache to complete the configuration. 

3. If any error occurs, the _dump_ file is generated. If the _dump_ file has been generated, check the root cause of the error through gdb. Use the `bt full` command to check the entire stack information.

   ```java
   # gdb /usr/sbin/httpd /home/httpd-core/core-httpd.31832
   ...
   ...

   > bt full
   ```

### PHP-FPM

1. In the FPM configuration file, set `rlimit_core`. 

   ```java
   rlimit_core = unlimited
   ```

2. Restart PHP-FPM to complete the configuration. 

3. If any error occurs, the _dump_ file is generated. If the _dump_ file has been generated, check the root cause of the error through gdb. Use the `bt full` command to check the entire stack information.

   ```java
   # gdb /usr/sbin/php-fpm /home/httpd-core/core-php-fpm.31832
   ...
   ...

   > bt full
   ```
