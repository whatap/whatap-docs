***TOP SQL*** extends the existing SQL statistics functionality to allow you to query and analyze data over a long period of time. You can search data for 1 minute to 30 days intervals, and provides analysis metrics in tab format so you can see them at a glance. Additionally, you can add trend charts to easily identify SQL occurrence patterns over a specific time period.
