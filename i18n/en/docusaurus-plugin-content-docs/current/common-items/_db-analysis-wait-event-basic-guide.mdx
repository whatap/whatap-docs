Select the <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" /> to view. You can see the wait data corresponding to the set time and instance. If there are active sessions that frequently wait (delay) during the query period, it can be used to analyze what types of wait events occurred.

![Wait Event Top 5](/img/db-analysis-wait-top5.png)

In **Wait Event Top 5**, you can see which wait events occurred most frequently. Using the above image as an example, the most frequently occurred type of wait event is **Lock**. If you select the ![number1](/img/number-01.png) detailed time in the graph chart, you can view the active sessions in the time and check the SQL statements in which the wait events occurred.
