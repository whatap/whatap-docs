## ![](/img/number-03.png) Metrics table

After setting the desired conditions in the condition area above, you can search the original data of the metric in a table format in the ![number3](/img/number-03.png) area. Columns in the table are changed when you specify the conditions for **_tag_** and **_field_**.
