The <Cmdname sid="side_eventSetting" className="uitext" /> <code class="newfunc">New</code> menu allows you to set the events based on the field (**Field**) rather than the category (**Category**). By providing basic event templates for the products of the created project, you can quickly and easily configure the warning notification events.

By configuring events to select fields first, the mismatch between user-perceived metrics and event settings is eliminated. By combining the visual intuition of the simulation, you can complete events quickly and accurately.

- New projects can use this feature without any separate settings.

- In a created project, clicking the <Cmdname sid="BTN07682" className="uitext" /> button automatically generates a list of events optimized for new features.

- The provided event templates may differ depending on the product.

- This event setting can be used by only the members with the <Cmdname sid="sms_alert_settings" className="b500" /> role. For more information about the member roles, see [the following](../project/project-structure#project-auth).
