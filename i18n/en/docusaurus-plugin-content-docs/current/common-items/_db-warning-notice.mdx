Alerts are sent through event condition settings per metric in the database. By entering thresholds for each metric, you can send alerts divided into <span class='vslow'>Fatal</span> and <span class='vslow'>Warning</span> levels.

## Default notification: Connection Failed

Even without configuring an alert, if there are 15 or more consecutive failures for database connection from the agent, the following notification is sent. Note that this could happen due to database shutdown, network issues, or account and role issues.

## Setting the alert

Depending on the user-selected <Cmdname sid="metrics" className="uitext" /> item, if the events that meet the condition of the entered <Cmdname sid="fatal" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="warn" className="uitext" /> item count occur as many as <Cmdname sid="number_of_detections" className="uitext" />, you can set to send the alert.

2. If you select <Cmdname sid="add_notification" className="uitext" />, an event is created at the bottom of the screen.

3. Select a desired metric in <Cmdname sid="metrics" className="uitext" />.

4. Enter numeric values for <Cmdname sid="fatal" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="warn" className="uitext" />.

## Copying the alert

You can copy any alert events created on the selected instance to another instance.

1. Select ![copy icon](/img/ico-copy.svg) <Cmdname sid="copy_notification" className="uitext" />. 

2. Select the target instance to copy. Select <Cmdname sid="all_selected" className="uitext" /> to copy to all instances.

3. Select <Cmdname sid="copy" className="uitext" />.

:::caution

If you use the <Cmdname sid="copy_notification" className="uitext" /> function in a state where there are alert events created in the target instance to copy, the existing alerts are deleted.

## Disabling the repeated alerts

This can prevent excessive alerts from happening. No alerts are sent for the selected period after the first alert is generated. In addition, they are not recorded in <Cmdname sid="event_history" className="uitext" />.

In <Cmdname sid="BTN07592" className="uitext" />, select a desired time and then select the toggle button on the right to turn on or off the function.

:::note

When the <Cmdname sid="BTN07592" className="uitext" /> option is enabled, if the agent fails to receive data during the set time period, the <span class="uitext">INACTIVE MONITORING AGENT</span> alert appears.
