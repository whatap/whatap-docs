## Non-HTTP transaction tracing

- **trace_auto_transaction_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Collection is not allowed when the trace target method is not performed within the transaction start point (`Javax.http.httpservlet`, `hook_service_*`). In this case, set to make the trace target method become the transaction start point.

  :::note

  This is used when finding the end point of the background transaction mainly in the development environment.

  :::

- **trace_auto_transaction_backstack_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  If the value of the `trace_auto_transaction_enabled` option is `true`, the stack trace is recorded upon start of transaction. As the above, the start point of transaction can be found.

- **trace_background_socket_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Tracing is recorded even when the socket is opened by the background, not by the transaction.

- **async_stack_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to use the active stack function for the background threads.

- **async_thread_match** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the background thread name for dumping the active stacks. To set multiple items, use comma (,) as the delimiter. When setting the name, you can use a comparison pattern using an asterisk (\*), such as "Thread-\*."

- **async_thread_parking_class** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `sun.misc.Unsafe`

  If the top method of the stack is a class or method registered in `async_thread_parking`, the system considers that the thread is parked and does not generate any dump.

- **hook_service_patterns** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets the starting point pattern for tracing NON-Http transactions. Wildcard characters cannot be used. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

- **hook_serivce_ignore_methods** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Among the settings in `hook_service_patterns`, unnecessary methods as the start point can be added.

- **hook_service_supers** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set this if the common denominator of the start points for non-HTTP transaction tracing inherits a method from a specific class.

- **hook_service_interfaces** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set this if the common denominator of the start points for non-HTTP transaction tracing has implemented a specific interface.

- **hook_service_access_public_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting the transactions for the non-HTTP daemon process, it sets the access permission criteria to on or off only for public methods.

- **hook_service_access_private_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting the transactions of the non-HTTP daemon process, it sets the access permission criterion to on or off only for private methods.

- **hook_service_access_protected_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting the transactions of the non-HTTP daemon process, it sets the access permission criterion to on or off only for protected method.

- **service_name_mode** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `full`

  You can use the following options with the transaction name.

  - `full`: Full class name is used.
  - `class`: The service name is used with the service name.
  - `method`: The service name is used with the method name.
  - `string`: The service name is used with the first parameter in the string.
  - `arg`: Among parameters, the service name is used with the parameter of the index set in the `service_name_index` option.
