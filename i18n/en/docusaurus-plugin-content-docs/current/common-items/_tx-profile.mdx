You can view the statistics on the performance properties and execution status for each transaction for a specific period of time. You can view all transactions and quickly check their status (normal or error). Through the provided information, you can find which transactions are busy and resource-consuming. Various filters can be enabled depending on the transaction properties, making it useful in finding transactions with specific conditions.
