**How to fix missing of msvcp120.dll and msvcr120.dll**

If you cannot run the xos agent because the *msvcp120.dll* and *msvcr120.dll* files are missing, it is because Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable 2013 is not installed or is corrupted. You can resolve this issue by installing the **Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package**.

Download and install the package that matches the system environment from the following link.\
[Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/ko-kr/download/details.aspx?id=40784)

- **vcredist_x64.exe**: For running 64-bit applications

- **Service registration**

  Register in the service by running the *install_WindowsService.bat* file in the xos folder as follows. If you do not enter a name after the `create` option, the service is registered by default with the name of **WhatapXOSAgent**.

  ```bash
  install_WindowsService.bat create WhatapXOSAgent
  ```

- **Deletion of a service**

  ```bash
  install_WindowsService.bat delete WhatapXOSAgent
  ```

:::note

To transmit monitored data to the DBX agent, the port set to `dbx_port` (default 3002) must have been open. (**UDP Outbound**)
