### Configuration for monitoring AWS RDS logs

![AWS RDS Log](/img/aws-rds-log-diagram.png)

AWS provides various information for RDS monitoring. To check information, directly access the AWS console. However, WhaTap's **AWS RDS Log** provides logs and events from RDS in <Cmdname sid="side_log" className="uitext" /> under Database Monitoring.

WhaTap's **AWS RDS Log** can be installed through **AWS CloudFormation**. For more information about **AWS CloudFormation**, see [the following link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ko_kr/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html).

### Checking the roles
