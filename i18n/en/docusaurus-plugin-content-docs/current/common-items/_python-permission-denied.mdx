## Permission denied error

To use WhaTap Python Monitoring, the **read and write** role is required. 

- Read and write role of the_ $WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf_ file
- Read and write permission for the _$WHATAP_HOME/logs_ log directory and subordinate files

If the permission denied error occurs, give the role for `$WHATAP_HOME`.

```bash
$ echo `sudo chmod -R 777 $WHATAP_HOME`
```
