In <Cmdname sid="integratedFlexboard" className="uitext" />, you can share a created dashboard with other members or copy it for reuse.

## Differences between sharing and copying

![Difference between sharing and copying](/img/flexboard-compare-sharing-copy.png)

- If you share a dashboard, all shared members can see the dashboard.

- If you copy a dashboard to another member or yourself, you can see the separate copied dashboard.

- Members who have a shared or copied dashboard with <Cmdname sid="read_only" className="uitext" /> mode cannot edit the dashboard, but can edit a dashboard shared or copied with <b>Edit Mode</b>

- The shared members for the dashboard with <Cmdname sid="read_only" className="uitext" /> can share the dashboard as read-only and can copy it.

- You can share any dashboard with the members invited to one or more projects that are included in the dashboard. Check that the members to be shared or copied belong to the project.

:::note

**Dashboard sharing and copying features are updated**

In the past, the members to be shared or copied had to have the **Edit** role, but since [Service 2.3.0 release](../release-notes/service/service-2_3_x), as long as they belong to the project regardless of role, they can copy or share a dashboard. However, among the projects in the shared dashboard, the data cannot be viewed because they do not have the **Analysis view** role. For more information about member roles, see [the following](../project/project-structure#member-auth).

## Sharing the Flex board

You can see the same dashboard by sharing the created Flex board with other users. This allows users to share a project. If you have modified the shared dashboard, the other users can see the same dashboard. 

:::note

This feature can be used only in <Cmdname sid="integratedFlexboard" className="uitext" />. It cannot be used in the <Cmdname sid="flexboard" className="uitext" /> menu of the project.

1. Select <LinkImage img="ico-flexboard-share.svg" className="ico" /> of the dashboard you want to share from <Cmdname sid="dashboard_list" className="uitext" /> in <Cmdname sid="integratedFlexboard" className="uitext" />.

2. When the <Cmdname sid="share_dashboard" className="uitext" /> window appears, click the input field to select members to share with or directly enter the account.

   - You can add multiple members at once to share your dashboard with.

   - If you select <Cmdname sid="read_only" className="uitext" />, the shared members cannot modify the dashboard.

   - You can share any dashboard with the members invited to one or more projects that are included in the dashboard. Check that the members to be shared or copied belong to the project.
