Report is a document that reports the service usage status and failure records for individual projects. The persons in charge of service monitoring share the status report with the people of related departments. The monitoring data analysis is important because it serves as a metric for determining the direction of improvement. However, it is cumbersome to aggregate and document data from multiple dashboards.  

WhaTap's <Cmdname sid="side_report" className="uitext" /> menu supports **automated report creation**. Through the <Cmdname sid="side_report" className="uitext" /> menu, you can create weekly reports, share reports at the set times, and manage various templates.

**Difference between the report and integrated report**

Report menu generates a report for a single project. Accordingly, you can select a project and then access it through the report menu on the left. Integrated Report menu generates a report for multiple projects. It can be accessed through the main menu on the Home screen without selecting a project. For more information, see [the following](integrated-report).
