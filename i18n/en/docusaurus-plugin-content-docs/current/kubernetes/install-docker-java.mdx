<Tabs groupId='k8stype2'>

<TabItem value="dockerinstall" label="Docker Install" default>

To install the WhaTap application agent, create the *whatap.conf* file. Change `{YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}` to the top-level path of the project to install the agent.

```bash
cat >{YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}/whatap.conf <<EOL
whatap.server.host={proxyServer}
EOL
```

:::note

The *whatap.conf* file can be managed using the ConfigMap function in the user Kubernetes environment.

<TabItem value='latest' label='Including the latest version of the agent in the application image' default>

The following guides you to include **the latest version of the agent** in the application image.

1.  To include the WhaTap agent in the application image, add the following in the Dockerfile's final image build step. Change `{YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}` to the top-level path of the project to install the agent.

    ```docker
    # Create the WhaTap agent directory in the user container
    RUN mkdir -p /whatap

    # Copy the WhaTap Java agent to the user container
    COPY --from=whatap/kube_mon /data/agent/micro/whatap.agent.kube.jar /whatap

    # Copy the created whatap.conf file to the user container
    COPY {YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}/whatap.conf /whatap/
    ```

2.  Add the following to the startup command of Dockerfile.

    ```bash
    -javaagent:/whatap/whatap.agent.kube.jar -Dwhatap.micro.enabled=true
    ```

    See the following definition example of the following Dockerfile. 

    ```docker title='Dockerfile' showLineNumbers {4,7}
    FROM openjdk:8-jdk-slim
    RUN mkdir -p /app && mkdir /whatap
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=whatap/kube_mon /data/agent/micro/whatap.agent.kube.jar /whatap
    COPY ./whatap.conf /whatap
    COPY ./target/myApp.jar /app/
    CMD ["java","-javaagent:/whatap/whatap.agent.kube.jar","-Dwhatap.micro.enabled=true","-jar","/app/myApp.jar"]
    EXPOSE 8080
    ```

3.  Build the Docker. Change `{YOUR_DOCKERFILE_DIR}` to the path where Dockerfile is located. 

    ```docker
    cd {YOUR_DOCKERFILE_DIR}
    docker build -t {IMAGE_NAME} .
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='choice' label='Including the specified version of the agent in the application image' default>

The following guides you to include **the specified version of the agent** in the application image.

1.  To include the WhaTap agent in the application image, add the following in the Dockerfile's final image build step. Change `{YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}` to the top-level path of the project to install the agent.

    ```docker
    # Create the WhaTap agent directory in the user container
    RUN mkdir -p /whatap

    # Copy the WhaTap Java agent to the user container
    COPY --from=whatap/kube_mon /data/agent/micro/whatap.agent-*.jar /whatap

    # Copy the created whatap.conf file to the user container
    COPY {YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}/whatap.conf /whatap/
    ```

2.  Check the version of the WhaTap agent. 

    ```bash
    docker run whatap/kube_mon ls /data/agent/micro | grep -E 'whatap\.agent-(.*?\.)(.*?\.)(.*?\.)jar' | sort | tail -1

    # Displaying Sample
    ## whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar
    ```

3.  Add the following to the startup command of Dockerfile. In **X.Y.Z**, enter the agent version that you checked before. 

    ```bash
    -javaagent:/whatap/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -Dwhatap.micro.enabled=true
    ```

    See the following definition example of the following Dockerfile.

    ```docker title='Dockerfile' showLineNumbers {4,7}
    FROM openjdk:8-jdk-slim
    RUN mkdir -p /app && mkdir /whatap
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=whatap/kube_mon /data/agent/micro/whatap.agent-*.jar /whatap
    COPY ./whatap.conf /whatap
    COPY ./target/myApp.jar /app/
    CMD ["java","-javaagent:/whatap/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar","-Dwhatap.micro.enabled=true","-jar","/app/myApp.jar"]
    EXPOSE 8080
    ```

4.  Build the Docker. Change `{YOUR_DOCKERFILE_DIR}` to the path where Dockerfile is located.

    ```docker
    cd {YOUR_DOCKERFILE_DIR}
    docker build -t {IMAGE_NAME} .
    ```

<TabItem value="direct" label="Direct Installation">

1.  Select ***Download*** to download the installation file (*whatap.agent.java.tar.gz*).

2.  Upload the dockerfile to the server and then unzip the file.

    :::info

    To download to the installation server, execute the following command.

    ```bash
    wget https://api.whatap.io/agent/whatap.agent.java.tar.gz
    ```

    :::

3.  When unzipped, the *whatap* directory is created. Check the settings in the *whatap.conf* file under the *whatap* directory, and then modify it as follows:

    ```ini
    license={licenseKey}
    whatap.server.host={proxyServer}
    ```

4.  Add the following to the startup command of Dockerfile. Check the agent file under the *whatap* directory, and then enter the version in **X.Y.Z**.

    ```bash
    -javaagent:/whatap/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -Dwhatap.micro.enabled=true
    ```

    See the following definition example of the following Dockerfile.

    ```bash title='Dockerfile'
    FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
    RUN mkdir -p /app && mkdir /whatap
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY ./whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar /whatap/
    COPY ./whatap.conf /whatap/
    COPY ./target/myApp.jar myApp.jar
    COPY ./paramkey.txt /whatap/
    CMD ["java","-javaagent:/whatap/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar","-Dwhatap.micro.enabled=true","-jar","/app/myApp.jar"]
    EXPOSE 8080
    ```

:::note

-   *whatap-virtual-X.Y.Z.jar*: Monitoring target (sample application)

-   *whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar*: WhaTap agent

-   If the agent's file name is *whatap.agent-1.2.3.jar*, change the **X.Y.Z** part to **1.2.3**.

-   For more information about addition of JVM options, see [the following](https://docs.whatap.io/java/install-agent#addjvmopt).

:::tip

For Java 17 or later, add the `--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED` option related to the reflection.

:::

### Creating the paramkey file

Create the *paramkey.txt* file in the top-level path of the project, and then enter a 6-letter alphanumeric password.

-   The *paramkey.txt* file is used when decrypting parameters during monitoring. 

-   The password example is as follows: `ABCDEF`

## Configuring the container environment variables

After building Docker, set **container environment variables** in the Kubernetes environment. Add the following items in the *yaml* file for releasing the application. 

```yaml
env:
- name: NODE_IP
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
- name: OKIND
	value: {YOUR_OKIND_NAME}
- name: license
	value: {licenseKey}
- name: whatap_server_host
	value: {proxyServer}
- name: whatap_micro_enabled
	value: "true"
```

See the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: #DeploymentName
  labels:
    app: #AppLabel
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: #AppLabel
	replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: #AppLabel
		spec:
		  containers:
			- name: #ContainerName
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
			  env:
		    - name: NODE_IP
	        valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
				- name: NODE_NAME
		      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
		    - name: POD_NAME
		      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
				- name: OKIND
          value: #DeploymentName
				- name: license
					value: {licenseKey}
				- name: whatap_server_host
					value: {proxyServer}
				- name: whatap_micro_enabled
					value: "true"
```

:::note

**Roles of environment variables**

-   `NODE_IP`: Collects the IP address of the node where the current Pod has been hosted.

-   `NODE_NAME`: Collects the name of the node where the current Pod is running.

-   `POD_NAME`: Collects the name of the current Pod.

-   `OKIND` (optional): Groups applications for Pods. If set to a deployment name, the corresponding Pods are grouped together.

-   `license`: Key for agent authentication.

-   `whatap_server_host`: Host IP of the WhaTap collection server

-   `whatap_micro_enabled`: Enables integration with containers.

:::

## Checking the agent installation

-   To check whether the agent has been installed, go to ***Dashboard*** > ***Application Service Dashboard***.

-   If you have manually installed the downloaded file but cannot see the agent in ***Dashboard***, check the following.

    -   Execute the command, `ps -ef | grep whatap` in the container, and then check whether the agent options have been applied properly.

    -   Check the content of the container in the */whatap/logs* path. Agent logs are output in the format of *logs/`{whatap configuration file name}`-yyyymmdd.log*.
