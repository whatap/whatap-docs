At the bottom of **_Management_** > **_Agent installation_**, click **_Install Application_** > Select the **_Docker Java_** tab in Install guide.

This process adds the settings for applying the agent to the JVM option of the Java application running on the Docker container and packages the container images as follows:

:::note 

- EKS Fargate is to be supported later. 

- Git example code is provided to help you understand the Java application integration process. See [the following](https://github.com/whatap/kuber-apm-boilerplate/tree/main/java/springboot).

<Tabs groupId='k8stype2'>

<TabItem value="dockerinstall" label="Docker Install" default>

To install the WhaTap application agent, create the *whatap.conf* file. Change `{YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}` to the top-level path of the project to install the agent.

```bash
cat >{YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}/whatap.conf <<EOL
whatap.server.host={proxyServer}
EOL
```

#### Setting the Kubernetes internal application agent options

The settings required for the Kubernetes internal application agent can be configured in the *whatap.conf* file or through the container `env` field when releasing the agent. 

- The options in the *whatap.conf* file have higher priority than those set in the container `env` field. 

- If no value is set in *whatap.conf* or container `env`, the default value is used.

- Use the In case of 'license' and 'whatap.server.host options, use the **container environment variables** settings. For more information, check [the following] (#application-conf-check).

If any settings in the configuration file are changed or important settings are lost, the configuration may not work properly. Therefore, it is recommended to configure **container environment variables** in the Kubernetes environment. For more information about other agent control options, see [the following](https://docs.whatap.io/java/agent-control-function).

:::note 

**Option unavailable in the Kubernetes environment**

- `whatap.name`: Unique name by which the collection server identifies agents. The name is generated based on the object on which the agent is running. Random assignment of users may cause problems with agent identification. 

- `whatap.onode`: The Kubernetes cluster node name is set by default. It is used to receive information about the node to which the agent belongs. When specified by the user, it may be difficult to accurately identify the node. 

:::

:::note

**Checking the `whatap.server.host` setting of the application** <ScrollToLink anchor='application-conf-check' />

In some container images, you cannot directly set environment variables with `.` such as `whatap.server.host`. If this keeps the application agent from starting normally, directly modify the *whatap.conf* file to set the `whatap.server.host` value. The procedure how to check the `whatap.server.host` setting of the application is as follows: 

1. Enter into the WhaTap application container. 

2. By executing the following command, check whether the `whatap.server.host` value is included.

   ````
   ```bash 
   $ env | grep whatap.server.host
   ```
   ````

   **If no value is output**, it indicates that the container image cannot support configuration of the environment variables with `.`. In this case, use the configuration file instead of environment variables. Open the *whatap.conf* file and then manually set the `whatap.server.host` value as follows: 

   ````
   ```bash
   whatap.server.host={WhaTap Collection Server IP}
   ```
   ````

1. To include the WhaTap agent in the application image, add the following in the Dockerfile's final image build step. Change `{YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}` to the top-level path of the project to install the agent.

   ```docker
   # Create the WhaTap agent directory in the user container
   RUN mkdir -p /whatap

   # Copy the WhaTap Java agent to the user container
   COPY --from=whatap/kube_mon /data/agent/micro/whatap.agent.kube.jar /whatap

   # Copy the created whatap.conf file to the user container
   COPY {YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}/whatap.conf /whatap/

2. Add the following to the startup command of Dockerfile.

   ```bash
   -javaagent:/whatap/whatap.agent.kube.jar -Dwhatap.micro.enabled=true

The procedure how to check the `whatap.server.host` setting of the application is as follows:

For Java 17 or later, add the `--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED` option related to the reflection.

### Setting the security key {#security}

Set a security key to query SQL variables and perform HTTP queries, or use the Thread stop function.

- Java Agent 2.2.2 or later

  After creating the *security.conf* file in the `$WHATAP_HOME` path, enter a 6-character password consisting of alphabets and numbers as follows:

  ```ini title='security.conf'
  paramkey=ABCDEF # SQL variable and HTTP query lookup
  threadkill=ABCDEF # Thread stop function
  ```

- Java agent 2.2.2 or earlier

  After creating the *paramkey.txt* file in the `$WHATAP_HOME` path, enter a 6-character password consisting of alphabets and numbers as follows:

  ```ini title='paramkey.txt'
  ABCDEF # SQL variable and HTTP query lookup, thread stop function
  ```

:::tip

When updating the Java agent version to 2.2.2, the key values in the existing *paramkey.txt* file are automatically applied to the *security.conf* file. For example, if you used `FEDCBA` in *paramkey.txt* and updated to the version 2.2.2, it is applied to the *security.conf* file as follows:

```ini
paramkey=FEDCBA
threadkill=FEDCBA
```

If the *paramkey.txt* file does not exist, the key value of the *security.conf* file is automatically created as the key value of **WHATAP**.

## Configuring the container environment variables

After building Docker, set **container environment variables** in the Kubernetes environment. Add the following items in the *yaml* file for releasing the application. 

```yaml
env:
- name: NODE_IP
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
- name: OKIND
  value: {YOUR_OKIND_NAME}
- name: license
  value: {licenseKey}
- name: whatap.server.host
  value: {proxyServer}
- name: whatap.micro.enabled
  value: "true"
```

See the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: #DeploymentName
  labels:
    app: #AppLabel
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: #AppLabel
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: #AppLabel
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: #ContainerName
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: NODE_IP
          valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: "status.hostIP"}}
        - name: NODE_NAME
          valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: "spec.nodeName"}}
        - name: POD_NAME
          valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: "metadata.name "}}
        - name: OKIND
          value: #DeploymentName
        - name: license
          value: #licenseKey
        - name: whatap.server.host
          value: #proxyServer
        - name: whatap.micro.enabled
          value: "true"
```

:::note

**Roles of environment variables**

- `NODE_IP`: Collects the IP address of the node where the current Pod has been hosted.

- `NODE_NAME`: Collects the name of the node where the current Pod is running.

- `POD_NAME`: Collects the name of the current Pod.

- `OKIND` (optional): Groups applications for Pods. If set to a deployment name, the corresponding Pods are grouped together.

- `license`: Key for agent authentication.

- `whatap.server.host`: Host IP of the WhaTap collection server

- `whatap.micro.enabled`: Enables integration with containers.
