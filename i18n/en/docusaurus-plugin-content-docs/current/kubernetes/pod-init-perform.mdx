JVM-based applications including the springboot may fail the liveness check at initialization by using a large number of resources. If the liveness check fails over a specific number of times, the POD is deleted and restart is attempted infinitely, which may cause deployment failure.

If you use the **_POD initialization performance_** function of WhaTap Kubernetes, by analyzing the peak usage and initialization time at POD startup, you can get help in setting the optimal initial delay (liveness check exemption time).
