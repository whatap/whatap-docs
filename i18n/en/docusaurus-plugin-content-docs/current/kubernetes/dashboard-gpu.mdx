keywords: [ Kubernetes, Kubernetes Monitoring, GPU Dashboard ]
---

The **GPU Dashboard** provides a Kubernetes perspective to track relationships between Node - GPU (MIG) - Pod.  

* Visually maps Node - GPU (MIG) - Pod relationships to easily understand GPU resource allocation.  
* Displays Top 5 trends by utilization, temperature, and memory to quickly detect overuse or imbalance of resources.  
* Highlights critical states such as Pending or Unused GPUs to identify allocation gaps or abnormal usage patterns at a glance.  

### Permissions & Requirements

* **Supported environment**: Kubernetes cluster project  
* **Agent version**: Kubernetes Agent v1.8.7 or higher  
* Requires Open Agent installation  

## Main Screen

A visual dashboard to easily identify GPU resource status and usage within the cluster.

### GPU Resource Summary

Summarized GPU information (assigned nodes, Pods, GPU counts by status) collected during the last 5 minutes, shown in four widgets.

### GPU Map

Displays collected devices at the query time in a map chart.  

* Physical devices are labeled **P**, MIG instances are labeled **M**.  
* Grouping can be done by Node/Physical device, with options to color by status or utilization.  

### Usage

Shows the total cluster VRAM size and usage, average GPU utilization per device, and VRAM usage over the last 1 minute.

### GPU Performance Summary (Top 5)

Displays performance trends of major physical device metrics during the query period.  

* Utilization (%)  
* VRAM Usage (MiB)  
* Temperature (â„ƒ)  
* SM Active (%)  

### GPU / Node / Pod Lists

Lists of GPUs, Nodes, and Pods are displayed.  
* Node and Pod lists show the Top 5 items by GPU utilization.  
* The GPU list shows all GPUs collected at query time (data collected within the last 1 minute).
