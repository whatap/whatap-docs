At the bottom of **_Management_** > **_Agent installation_**, click **_Install Application_** > Select the **_Docker Python_** tab in Install guide.

This process applies the WhaTap monitoring agent to the Python application running on the Docker container and packages the container image as follows. To release the Kubernetes application, the Docker image is required. Create a Docker image with the whatap-python package installed using the following process.

:::note 

- EKS Fargate is to be supported later. 

- To help you understand the Python application integration process, Git example codes are provided. See [the following](https://github.com/whatap/kuber-apm-boilerplate/tree/main/python/fastapi).

:::

## Download agent

Install the whatap-python package when building your Python application docker image.

```docker
RUN pip3 install --upgrade whatap-python
```

See the following definition example of the following Dockerfile. 

```docker title='python ver 3.10'
# Install python3.10 In the Docker environment.
FROM python:3.10

# Set the working directory to /app.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy all the files and folers in the current directory to the /app directory in the container.
ADD . /app/

# In Python, any external library can be installed using pip. 
# Install the WhaTap Python agent when building the docker image.
RUN pip3 install --upgrade whatap-python
```

## Configuration and execution of the agent

Before running the application, determine the Python agent's working directory and then create a default configuration file. Pass the authentication information to the agent and set whether or not to trace logs through the configuration file (_entrypoint.sh_).

<details>
<summary>Configuration file (entrypoint.sh) example</summary>

```bash title='entrypoint.sh'
#!/bin/bash

# Set the working directory of the container to the WhaTap path. The agent logs and configuration file are generated in the path.
export WHATAP_HOME=${PWD}

# If any permission error occurs, remove the following comment.
#chmod -R 777 $WHATAP_HOME

# The following lists the settings required for agent configuration. Configure them through the yaml file for release of applications.
whatap-setting-config \
--host $whatap_server_host \
--license $license \
--app_name $app_name \
--app_process_name $app_process_name

# The following comments are additionally configured for agent grouping and activation of log collection. Use them if necessary.

# Agent grouping
# echo "whatap.okind=$whatap.okind" >> whatap.conf

# Activation of log collection
#echo "logsink_enabled=true" >> whatap.conf
#echo "logsink_trace_enabled=true" >> whatap.conf
#echo "trace_logging_enabled=true" >> whatap.conf


# Add whatap-start-agent before the application startup command to run the agent. 
whatap-start-agent uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

</details>

1. Set the container's working directory with the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable. Create the agent log and configuration files in the path. 

   ```bash
   export WHATAP_HOME=${PWD}
   ```

2. Execute the following command to create and configure the _whatap.conf_ file in the path set as `WHATAP_HOME`. Variables marked with `$` are required for agent configuration and are set through the _yaml_ file for releasing the application.

   ```bash
   whatap-setting-config \
   --host $whatap_server_host \
   --license $license \
   --app_name $app_name \
   --app_process_name $app_process_name
   ```

3. Run the agent by adding `whatap-start-agent` before the application startup command as follows: 

```bash
whatap-start-agent uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

:::caution

If any role issues, assign roles to the `$WHATAP_HOME` variable as follows:

```bash
echo `sudo chmod -R 777 $WHATAP_HOME`
```

:::

:::note 

- As an example of the _yaml_ file, see [Container environment variable settings](#k8s-env) as follows:

- The `license` is the user authentication information of WhaTap. **Do not expose to outside**.

:::

### Script running example

See the following definition example of the following Dockerfile. This is a complete example to run the _entrypoint.sh_ script.

```docker
FROM python:3.10
WORKDIR /app
ADD . /app/
RUN pip3 install --upgrade whatap-python 

# Assign a role to run the entrypoint.sh script in the container.
RUN chmod +x ./entrypoint.sh

# Execute the entrypoint.sh script when generating the container.
CMD ["./entrypoint.sh"]
```

### Additional function

The following settings are optional and must be used if necessary. In addition to the following additional settings in the configuration file (_entrypoint.sh_), log and transaction-related settings are also configurable. For additional settings, see [the following](https://docs.whatap.io/python/set-agent). 

- **Agent grouping** 

  ```bash
  echo "whatap.okind=$whatap.okind" >> whatap.conf
  ```

- **Enabling the log collection** 

  ```bash
  echo "logsink_enabled=true" >> whatap.conf
  echo "logsink_trace_enabled=true" >> whatap.conf
  echo "trace_logging_enabled=true" >> whatap.conf
  ```

## Configuring the container environment variables {#k8s-env}

After building Docker, set **container environment variables** in the Kubernetes environment. Add the following items in the _yaml_ file for releasing the application. 

```yaml
    env:
    - name: license
      value: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - name: whatap_server_host
      value: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    - name: app_name
      value: {YOUR_APP_NAME}
    - name: app_process_name
      value: {YOUR_PROCESS_NAME}
    - name: whatap.okind
      value: {YOUR_GROUP_NAME}
    - name: NODE_IP
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
    - name: NODE_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
```

See the following example: 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: python-fastapi-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: python-fastapi-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: python-fastapi-pod
  containers:
  - name: agent-python-fastapi
    image: whatap/agent-python-fastapi
    env:
    - name: license
      value: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - name: whatap_server_host
      value: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    - name: app_name
      value: "myapp-python-fastapi"
    - name: app_process_name
      value: "uvicorn"
    - name: NODE_IP
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
    - name: NODE_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
```

:::note

**Roles of environment variables**

- `license`: Key for agent authentication.

- `whatap_server_host`: Host IP of the WhaTap collection server

- `app_name`: Name to identify the agent for the application. For more information about the agent identification, see [the following](https://docs.whatap.io/python/agent-name).

- `app_process_name`: Set the target processes such as CPU and Heap Memory. For example, there are uwsgi and gunicorn.

- `whatap.okind` (optional): Groups applications for the Pod. If set using the deployment name, the corresponding Pods are grouped together.

- `NODE_IP`: Collects the IP address of the node where the current Pod has been hosted.

- `NODE_NAME`: Collects the name of the node where the current Pod is running.

- `POD_NAME`: Collects the name of the current Pod.

:::

## Checking the agent installation

- To check whether the agent has been installed, go to **_Dashboard_** > **_Application Service Dashboard_**.

- Run the `ps -ef | grep whatap_python` command in the container to check whether the Whatap Python service is running normally.
