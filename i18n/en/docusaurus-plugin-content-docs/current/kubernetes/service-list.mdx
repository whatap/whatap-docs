Through <Cmdname sid="side_kubeServiceList" className="uitext" /> of WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring, you can easily check the network configuration within the cluster and efficiently monitor the configuration and status of each service.

In Kubernetes, a **service** is an object for accessing Pods inside and outside the cluster. In <Cmdname sid="side_kubeServiceList" className="uitext" />, you can check the detailed configuration of each service at a glance, and monitor the status of connected Pods in real time. This allows you to quickly identify and resolve abnormal connectivity issues between services and Pods.
