**OpenMetrics Explorer** allows you to directly explore custom Prometheus-based metrics using PromQL, visualize them in various formats, and check the status of metrics or gain insights.

With this feature, you can freely query the desired metrics, extract meaningful data, or link them to dashboards for continuous monitoring.

### PromQL Syntax Support and Autocomplete

When entering metrics such as `node_cpu_seconds_total` or `container_memory_usage_bytes`, autocomplete provides suggestions for metrics and operators.

Label filtering in the form of `{pod="example"}` is also supported.

## Add to Dashboard

You can save the queried PromQL as a dashboard widget to continuously monitor desired metrics.

### How to Add
