Home > Select Project > <Cmdname sid="cluster" className="uitext" /> > **_Namespace Status_**

Through **_Namespace Status_**, you can see the WhaTap Kubernetes cluster project and sub namespace projects. This menu cannot be accessed by the namespace project. 

<ImgLang img='k8s-namespace-status.png' desc='Namespace Status' />

The **_Namespace Status_** menu is similar to the project list screen, but has the following differences:

- **Project list**

  After creating a namespace project, you can move the project to another group, but the namespace is difficult to see at a glance.

- **Namespace status**

  - Namespaces that do not belong to the same group as the cluster project can also be checked.

  - You can see all related projects at a glance.

In case of the cluster project, the <span class='normal'>blue</span> <code class='my'>Kubernetes</code> tag appears that indicates the Kubernetes platform. In the namespace project, the <code class='my'>Namspace</code> tag appears. The title on the upper left of the widget is the project name, and the namespace name appears next to the <code class='my'>Namspace</code> tag at the bottom.
