The **_Container Map_** in WhaTap Kubernetes is the starting point for Kubernetes monitoring. Depending on the custom view, each object represents a container or pod. 

-   Using the container map, you can select targets to analyze and organize groups. 

-   By setting the status metrics and thresholds, you can see the status of individual containers or pods at a glance.

-   You can select individual containers or pods for detailed information. It provides key monitoring data such as **_Trace_**, **_Metrics_**, **_Logs_**, and **_Event_**.

The following video clip is the guide to the **_Container Map_** menu.

## Basic screen guide

<ImgLang img='k8s-container-map.png' desc='Container Map' />

### ![](/img/number-01.png) Go to Cluster Project - Namespace Project

<ImgLang img='k8s-namespace-project-list.png' desc='Container Map Project List' />

When a namespace project is created under the cluster project ![Cluster project icon](/img/ic-cluster-project.svg), if you select ![Down arrow icon](/img/ico-more-down.svg) **_More_** on the container map, a project list box appears. Through the project list box, you can see the project list including cluster projects and move between them. 

:::note

For more information about the namespace project creation and management, see [the following](namespace).

### ![](/img/number-02.png) User configuration

<ImgLang img='container-map-custom-view.png' desc='custom setting' />

A container map provides multiple user settings that allow you to create any desired screen view. The functions available in the screen are as follows in order.

-   Category: You can select the targets to analyze. You can also set the **_container_** or **_pod_**.

-   **_Group by_**: Through the **_Group by_** (clustering) option, the hierarchical relationships between cluster components can be displayed in two levels. For more information, see [the following](container-group).

-   **_ConState(state)_**: You can select any chart metric.

-   If you click ![Configuration icon](/img/ico-setting.svg), you can select any option to display information of containers or pods on each object.

    <ImgLang img='k8s-container-map-setting.png' desc='option' />

    -   **_Show WhaTap Agent_**: The container or pod data can be displayed. Select a desired **_label_** option. For more information about the label option, see [the following](#label).

    -   **_Show metrics at the bottom of the card_**: You can select whether or not to display the metrics information at the bottom.

    -   **_Show containers created within 1 minute_**: This option displays containers created within 1 minute in bright colors.

-   ![Filter icon](/img/ico-filter.svg) **_Filter_**: You can see the status of containers or pods by filtering them based on your selections.

-   ![Reset icon](/img/ico-reset.svg) **_Reset_**: It initializes the screen view set by you.

#### Label options{#label}

-   **_None_**: Labels are not displayed in the block.

-   **_Name_**: The container or pod name is displayed.

-   **_Application_**: The application in the container or pod is displayed.

-   **_Selected metrics_**: The chart metric selected in **_ConState(state)_** is displayed.

#### Real-time and historical inquiries

Container maps are based on real-time lookups based on multiple viewpoints. Use the time selector at the top left of the screen to change the real-time inquiry.

<ImgLang img='kubernetes-time-seletor.png' desc='Time selector' />

| Lookup status               | Description                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time inquiry (LIVE)    | Default mode<br/>Real-time status changes every 10 seconds.                           |
| Paused inquiry (PAUSE)      | Real-time status change OFF<br/>Used to check the current status in detail.           |
| Historical inquiry          | You can specify a past time to check<br/>Year/Month/Day/Hour/Minute                   |

### ![](/img/number-03.png) Container map chart{#container-map-chart}

<ImgLang img='k8s-container-map-chart.png' desc='Container map chart' />

-   ![number 1](/img/char-a.svg) The total number of grouped targets and the key resource count are displayed.

-   ![number 2](/img/char-b.svg) The shapes and colors for each object display the characteristics and status for containers or pods.

    -   Color: Indicates the container or pod status. For more information about the status other than <span class='normal'>Normal</span>, <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>, see [the following](container-status).

    -   Border

        -   Some objects have borders. The targets are what have installed microagents like Java, Node.js, Python, and such in the container. 

        -   If there are 2 containers in a pod and the micro agents are installed on only 1 of 2 containers, the borders are displayed. In other words, if any of the containers in the pod have micro agents installed, the borders are displayed.

    :::note 

    **Block and micro block**

    ![Block and micro block sc](/img/k8s-block-container.png)

    In the **_Container map_**, the single polygon is called a **block**. At this time, the block with an agent (a block within a block) is called a **micro block**.

    :::

    :::note 

    **Group**

    ![Container block group sc](/img/k8s-container-map-group.png)

    When the entire block is selected on the **_Container Map_** screen, the multiple block is called a group. 

    :::

-   ![number 3](/img/char-c.svg) It displays the metrics related to the CPU and memories for the grouped targets.

-   ![number 4](/img/char-d.svg) It displays the transaction information for the applications in the grouped targets.

## Summary view and Detailed view

You can select an interested container or pod to view the summary and detailed information. The information includes the key monitoring data as follows:

-   **Trace**

    It is the APM tool to trace applications on the container. 

-   **Metrics**

    They are various metrics data for nodes and Kubernetes. 

-   **Log**

    Various logs for containers and applications.

-   **Event**

    It indicates recording the events that occur while running the containers and applications. 

Based on these data, you can obtain the observability of the Kubernetes environment. Both the **Display Summary** and **Display Detail** provide information based on the above 4 items.

### Summary view

Click a specific object or a set of objects. You can check the summary data of the object through the **Display Summary** screen that appears on the right.

<ImgLang img='k8s-container-map-sum-all.png' desc='Summary view' />

-   **_Trace_**

    Under the **_Trace_** tab in the container map, you can trace each individual transactions of the applications running on the container.

-   **_Metrics_**

    Under the **_Metrics_** tab in the container map, you can see various metrics data such as resource quotas and usages for each container in real time.

-   **_Log_** 

    Under the **_Log_** tab in the container map, you can manage and view standard logs for each container and application logs on the container.

-   **_Event_** 

    Under the **_Event_** tab in the container map, you can see integrated views for the events that occurred in the Kubernetes cluster and user threshold events based on the WhaTap's alert function. 

### Display Detail

On the upper right of **View Summarized**, click ![View Detailed icon](/img/ico-detail-mode.svg). The **View Detailed** screen appears. For more information about **View Detailed** screen layout, see [the following](container-map-detail-mode).

<ImgLang img='container-map-detail-mode.png' desc='Display Detail' />
