The container map in WhaTap Kubernetes is the starting point for Kubernetes monitoring. Depending on the custom view, each object represents a container or pod.

## ![](/img/number-01.png) Container or Pod

The shapes and designs for each object represent the characteristics and states of the container or pod.

-   Color: Container or pod state. For more information, see [the following](container-status).
-   Border
    -   Some objects have borders. The targets are what have installed microagents like Java, Node.js, Python, and such in the container. 
    -   If there are 2 containers in a pod and the microagents are installed on only 1 of 2 containers, the borders are displayed. In other words, if any of the containers in the pod have microagents installed, the borders are displayed.

## ![](/img/number-02.png) Go to Cluster Project - Namespace Project

![Container map project list](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_kubernetes_container_map_namespace_project_list.png)

If a namespace project is created under a cluster project, you can check the list of projects including cluster projects and move between projects through the project list box on the container map screen.

:::note

-   WhaTap Kubernetes Service's **cluster project** is a new name for the **master project**.
-   For more information about the namespace project creation, see [the following](namespace).

## ![](/img/number-03.png) User configuration

![User configuration](/img/container-map-custom-view.png)

A container map provides multiple user settings that allow you to create any desired screen view. The functions available in the screen are as follows in order.

-   Category: You can select **_Container_** or **_Pod_**.

-   **_Grouping_** (clustering): You can select conditions for grouping. The containers or pods are classified into cards based on the selected conditions. For more information, see [the following](container-group).

-   **_ConState(state)_**: You can select any chart metric.

-   If you click ![Configuration icon](/img/ico-setting.svg), you can select any option to display information of containers or pods on each object.

    ![Option](/img/k8s-container-map-setting.png)

    -   **_Show WhaTap Agent_**: You can display information of containers or pods. Select a desired **_label_** option.

    -   **_Show metrics at the bottom of the card_**: You can select whether or not to display the metrics information at the bottom.

    -   **_Show containers created within 1 minute_**: This option displays containers created within 1 minute in bright colors.

-   ![Filter icon](/img/ico-filter.svg) **_Filter_**: You can see the status of containers or pods by filtering them based on your selections.

-   ![Reset icon](/img/ico-reset.svg) **_Reset_**: It initializes the screen view set by you.

## Summary view and Detailed view

You can select an interested container or pod to view the summary and detailed information. The information includes the key monitoring data as follows:

-   Trace
-   Metrics
-   Log
-   Event

Based on these data, you can obtain the observability of the Kubernetes environment. Both the **Display Summary** and **Display Detail** provide information based on the above 4 items.

### Summary view

Click a specific object or a set of objects. You can check the summary data of the object through the **Display Summary** screen that appears on the right.

### Detailed view

On the upper right of the **Display Summary** screen, click ![Display Detail icon](/img/ico-detail-mode.svg). **Display Detail** appears.

## Real-time and historical inquiries

Container maps are based on real-time lookups based on multiple viewpoints. Use the time selector at the top right of the screen to change the real-time inquiry.

![Time Selector](/img/kubernetes-time-seletor.png)
