Select Home &gt; cluster project (<code class='my'>CP</code>) &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_controlPlane" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_kubeSchedulerDashboard" className="uitext" />

:::note

**Requirements**

- The WhaTap Kubernetes agent 1.8.1 or later is required.

- If it is a Kubernetes cluster project (<code class='my'>CP</code>), you can view the corresponding menu.

- You can use this menu if the cluster can observe the vanilla Kubernetes or `kube-scheduler` Pods. 

:::

`kube-scheduler` is a major component responsible for scheduling Pods in the Kubernetes environment. WhaTap provides the <Cmdname sid="side_kubeSchedulerDashboard" className="uitext" /> to monitor the performance and scheduling status of `kube-scheduler` in real time. The <Cmdname sid="side_kubeSchedulerDashboard" className="uitext" /> can help you proactively prevent the cluster from entering an unschedulable state or encountering issues due to scheduler overload in advance. 

## Basic screen guide

<ImgLang img="k8s-kube-scheduler-dashboard.png" desc="kube-scheduler dashboard" />

<Cmdname sid="side_kubeSchedulerDashboard" className="uitext" /> provides visualizations of key metrics collected over the past hour, broken down at 1-minute intervals. The key metrics you can see on the dashboard are as follows. For the metrics details, see the [metric guide](#kube-scheduler-metrics) at the bottom.

- It provides the resource usage trend, Pod restart count, and detailed logs for `kube-scheduler`.

- It provides the trend for the numbers of preemption attempts by `kube-scheduler` and the number of victims due to preemption.

- It provides the trends for each reason of pending Pods assigned to the pending queue inside the `kube-scheduler` Pod.

## Enabling the kube-scheduler monitoring

### Enabling requirements

- You must be able to observe the `kube-scheduler` Pod via the command, `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l component=kube-scheduler`. 

- To enable secure communication with `kube-scheduler`, change the `--bind-address` setting to be accessible from outside. Typically `0.0.0.0` is used.

### Enabling procedure

:::note 

**Enabling order**

1. Add the `GET` role for `secrets` to RBAC of the whatap service account.

2. Generate `secrets` based on the whatap service account.

3. Apply the `kube-scheduler` monitoring activation option to the `whatap-master-agent` deployment.

:::

1. **Role configuration** 

   Add the `secrets` resource to the resources accessible from `rules` of whatap ClusterRole inside the `whatap-monitoring` namespace. After creating the following content as a *yaml* file, execute the `kubectl apply -f <yaml file name>.yaml` command for application. 

   ```yaml title='ClusterRole.yaml' {25}
   apiVersion: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1"
   kind: "ClusterRole"
   metadata:
     annotations:
       rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
     name: "whatap"
     namespace: "whatap-monitoring"
   rules:
   - apiGroups:
     - "*"
     resources:
     - "namespaces"
     - "pods"
     - "pods/log"
     - "configmaps"
     - "services"
     - "endpoints"
     - "daemonsets"
     - "ingresses"
     - "deployments"
     - "nodes"
     - "persistentvolumes"
     - "persistentvolumeclaims"
     - "events"
     - "secrets"
     - "replicasets"
     - "roles"
     - "rolebindings"
     - "clusterroles"
     - "clusterrolebindings"
     - "jobs"
     - "cronjobs"
     - "statefulsets"
     - "serviceaccounts"
     - "configmaps"
     - "storageclasses"
     - "horizontalpodautoscalers"
     - "replicationcontrollers"
     verbs:
     - "get"
     - "list"
     - "watch"
   - apiGroups:
     - ""
     resources:
     - "pods/exec"
     verbs:
     - "create"
   - apiGroups:
     - ""
     resources:
     - "configmaps"
     verbs:
     - "*"
   - nonResourceURLs:
     - "/metrics"
     verbs:
     - "*"
   ```

2. **Creating the secret**

   After creating the following content as a *yaml* file, execute the `kubectl apply -f yamlfilename.yaml` command for application. 

   ```yaml title='secrets.yaml'
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
   metadata:
     name: whatap-scheduler-monitoring-token
     namespace: whatap-monitoring
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/service-account.name: "whatap"
   ```

3. **Deployment modification**

   After modifying the `whatap-master-agent` deployment content, execute the `kubectl apply -f <yaml file name>.yaml` command for application. 

   - **Addition of environment variables**

     Add the following to the `env` section of the `whatap-master-agent` container under `containers`.

     ```yaml
     env:
     - name: "collect_kube_scheduler_monitoring_enabled"
       value: "true"
     ```

   - **Adding command arguments** 

     Add the following to the `args` section of the `whatap-control-plane-helper` container under `containers`. 

     ```yaml
     - args:
       - "-collect_kube_scheduler_monitoring_enabled=true"
     ```

   See the following example for adding environment variables and command arguments. 

   ```yaml {30-31,51}
   apiVersion: "apps/v1"
   kind: "Deployment"
   metadata:
     name: "whatap-master-agent"
