:::note

**Requirements**

You can see the <Cmdname sid="side_clusterOverview" className="uitext" /> menu only for the Kubernetes cluster project (<code class='my'>CP</code>).

:::

You can check summary information about the cluster. You can integrate the data separated by the namespace project.

## Cluster object

You can check versions related to the cluster and the number of Kubernetes objects such as nodes, Pods, and containers within the cluster. 

:::note 

- You can check the **_cluster version_** when the Kubernetes agent version is 1.4.1 or later.

- If the Kubernetes agent version is 1.3.6 or later, you can check the following: 

  - **_kubelet Version_** 

  - **_Container Runtime_**

## Cluster Integration Information

You can see cluster project information and the Pods, containers, logs, event count, and event list separated by the namespace project.

:::note
