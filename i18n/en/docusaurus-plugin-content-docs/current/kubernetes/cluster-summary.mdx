You can check summary information about the cluster. You can integrate the data separated by the namespace project.

:::note

You can check the **_Cluster summary_** menu only if it is a cluster project.

## Cluster object

You can check versions related to the cluster and the number of Kubernetes objects such as nodes, Pods, and containers within the cluster. 

:::note 

- You can check the **_cluster version_** when the Kubernetes agent version is 1.4.1 or later.

- If the Kubernetes agent version is 1.3.6 or later, you can check the following: 

  - **_kubelet Version_** 

  - **_Container Runtime_**

#### Cluster Version

- Data at an interval of 5 seconds. When viewing real-time data, the data is called once every 5 seconds.

#### kubelet Version

- Data at an interval of 5 seconds. When viewing real-time data, the data is called once every 5 seconds.

#### Container Runtime

- Data at an interval of 5 seconds. When viewing real-time data, the data is called once every 5 seconds.

#### Number of nodes

- Data at an interval of 5 seconds. When viewing real-time data, the data is called once every 5 seconds.

#### Number of Pods

- Data at an interval of 5 seconds. When viewing real-time data, the data is called once every 5 seconds.

- **_Available Pods_**: Indicates the number of Pods allocated to the node. 

- **_Unavailable Pods_**: Indicates the number of Pods that are not allocated to the node.

- **_Desired Pods_**: Indicates the number of intended Pods. 

  > **_Available Pods_** + **_Unavailable Pods_**

#### Number of Containers

- You can check the number of containers by status. 

- Data at an interval of 5 seconds. When viewing real-time data, the data is called once every 5 seconds.

#### Kubernetes Object list

- You can check the Kubernetes object list (**_Deployment_**, **_ReplicaSet_**, **_Namespace_**, **_StatefulSet_**).

- Data at an interval of 5 minutes. When viewing real-time data, the data is called once every 3 minutes.

#### Object count trend

- You can see how the number of Kubernetes objects (**_Deployment_**, **_ReplicaSet_**, **_Namespace_**, **_StatefulSet_**) has changed over 24 hours.

- Data at an interval of 5 minutes. When viewing real-time data, the data is called once every 3 minutes.

## Cluster Integration Information

You can see cluster project information and the Pods, containers, logs, event count, and event list separated by the namespace project.

:::note 

To view the data, the **Read** role is required for the namespace project.
