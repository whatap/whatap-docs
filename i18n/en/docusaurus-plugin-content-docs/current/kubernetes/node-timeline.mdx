:::note 

**Requirements**

- The WhaTap Kubernetes agent 1.7.11 or later is required. Timeline data is provided from the time point collected in version 1.7.11 or later. It reflects the data collected after update of the agent.

- If it is a Kubernetes cluster project (<code class='my'>CP</code>), you can view the corresponding menu.

:::

The <Cmdname sid="side_nodeTimeline" className="uitext" /> menu provides the feature to trace changes in node state over time. Through this, you can visually identify when a disappeared node was removed and what state the node was in at that time. It is useful for analyzing issues that occurred during cluster operation or checking the past situations.

## Basic screen guide

When you enter the <Cmdname sid="side_nodeTimeline" className="uitext" /> menu, a list of nodes collected over the past 7 days is displayed as follows. You can visually see the state changes of nodes along the time axis. If you hover your mouse over each time zone, the start and end times for the zone appears as tooltips together with the node's status (***Ready***, ***NotReady***, etc.).

You can adjust the time range by dragging the zone on the timeline. Set a desired period to check the past data. 

<ImgLang img='k8s-node-timeline-drag.png' />

Additionally, when you select a specific period, you can check the node status during the period in detail through **Display Detail**. For more information, see the [Node timeline detail](#node-timeline-details) guidance. 

:::note 

- For more information about the node status, see [the following](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#node-status). 

- For more information on how to use the time selector, see [the following](usage-ui#timeselector).

## Node timeline detail {#node-timeline-details}

Node timeline details can be checked by selecting a specific zone or node as follows: 

<ImgLang img='k8s-node-timeline-stage.png' />

- You can view detailed information of a node at the time point through the **Display Detail** window on the right by selecting a zone to view. 

- You can select a node name to view from the list on the left of the chart and view the overall status of the node during the query period through the **Display Detail** window on the right. 

### <Cmdname sid="TTL08441" className="uitext" type="node" />

It provides a summary of the node configuration and overall resource usage selected in the<Cmdname sid="TTL08441" className="uitext" type="node" /> tab. You can comprehensively see the hardware and software components of the node. Users can monitor resource usage of nodes and the status of each component, as well as performance and operational stability.

<ImgLang img='k8s-node-timeline-config.png' />

- **Node system specifications**

  - ***Architecture***: Hardware architecture used by the node.

  - ***Image***: Information about the operating system image that the node is running on.

  - ***CapacityMemory***: Total memory capacity of the node.

  - ***CapacityCpu***: Total CPU capacity of the node.

- **Software configuration** 

  - ***Container Runtime***: Version of the container runtime used on the node. 

  - ***kubelet***: Version of the Kubernetes kubelet running on the node. 

  - ***kube-proxy***: Version of the kube-proxy that manages the network features. 

- **Resource usage status** 

  - ***CPU***: CPU usage of the node.

  - ***Memory***: Memory usage of the node.

  - ***Disk***: Disk capacity and usage rate on the node.

  - ***Network***: Network throughput 

:::note 

By clicking ***AVG*** and ***MAX***, you can see the average usage and maximum usage for the query period.

:::

### <Cmdname sid="resource" className="uitext" />

<Cmdname sid="resource" className="uitext" /> In the tab, you can see the list of ***Pods*** scheduled on the selected node and the ***containers*** and ***applications*** running in those Pods. The information appears reflecting 1 minute of resource data as of the end of the selected time zone. This allows you to more clearly identify the node status at the time point and the operation status of each Pod, container, and application.

<ImgLang img='k8s-node-timeline-resource.png' />

:::note 

When the <Cmdname sid="overview" className="uitext" /> column is selected, you can see the summary analysis for container and Pod.

:::

### <Cmdname sid="metrics" className="uitext" />

You can check the resource usage trend of the node select in the <Cmdname sid="metrics" className="uitext" /> tab. You can see the usage changes in ***CPU***, ***memory***, ***network***, and ***disk*** based on the average (***AVG***) and maximum (***MAX***) values during the query period.

<ImgLang img='k8s-node-timeline-metrics.png' />

- ***AVG***: Average usage for the query period.

- ***MAX***: Maximum usage for the query period.

- ***Total***: Total traffic usage across multiple network interfaces.

- ***In/Out***: Inbound (receiving) and outbound (sending) traffic usage for a specific network interface.

### <Cmdname sid="event" className="uitext" />

You can see ***K8s Node events*** and ***WhaTap Node events*** that occurred for the time of the timeline in the <Cmdname sid="event" className="uitext" /> tab. ***K8s node events*** include important activity logs within the cluster such as changes in node status, while ***WhaTap node events*** provide information about the events triggered based on the user-defined alert criteria.
