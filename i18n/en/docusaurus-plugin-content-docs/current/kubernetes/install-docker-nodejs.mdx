import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

At the bottom of **_Management_** > **_Agent installation_**, click **_Install Application_** > Select the **_Docker Node.js_** tab in Install guide.

This process applies the WhaTap monitoring agent to the Node.js application running on the Docker container and packages the container image as follows. 

:::note 

-   EKS Fargate is to be supported later. 

-   To help you understand the Node.js application integration process, Git example codes are provided. See [the following](https://github.com/whatap/kuber-apm-boilerplate/tree/main/nodejs/express).

:::

## Download agent

Execute the following command to install WhaTap.

```bash
npm install --save whatap
```

To update the agent, execute the following command.

```bash
npm update whatap
```

## Agent CONFIG.

Add the following code to the first line of your application's main module.

```javascript title='Example'
const WhatapAgent = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
WhatapAgent.NodeAgent;
```

When using ECMAScript (ES), add the following code:

```javascript
import WhatapAgent from 'whatap';
WhatapAgent.NodeAgent;
```

## Configuring the container environment variables

After building Docker, set **container environment variables** in the Kubernetes environment. Add the following items in the _yaml_ file for releasing the application. 

```yaml
env:
- name: NODE_IP
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
- name: OKIND
	value: {YOUR_OKIND_NAME}
- name: license
	value: {licenseKey}
- name: whatap_server_host
	value: {proxyServer}
- name: whatap_micro_enabled
	value: "true"
```

See the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: #DeploymentName
  labels:
    app: #AppLabel
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: #AppLabel
	replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: #AppLabel
		spec:
		  containers:
			- name: #ContainerName
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
			  env:
		    - name: NODE_IP
	        valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
				- name: NODE_NAME
		      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
		    - name: POD_NAME
		      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
				- name: OKIND
          value: #DeploymentName
				- name: license
					value: {licenseKey}
				- name: whatap_server_host
					value: {proxyServer}
				- name: whatap_micro_enabled
					value: "true"
```

## Checking the agent installation

-   To check whether the agent has been installed, go to **_Dashboard_** > **_Application Service Dashboard_**.

-   If you have manually installed the downloaded file but cannot see the agent in **_Dashboard_**, check the following.

    -   Execute the command, `ps -ef | grep whatap` in the container, and then check whether the agent options have been applied properly.

    -   Check the content in the _/whatap/logs_ path of the container.
