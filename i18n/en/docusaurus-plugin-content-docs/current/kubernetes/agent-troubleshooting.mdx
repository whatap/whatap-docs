## Installation troubleshooting based on the Helm chart {#troubleshooting-helm-chart}

<div class ='faq'>

### In case there is a `whatap` Helm repository with the same name

| "whatap" already exists with the same configuration, skipping |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- |

If another `whatap` repository with the same name already exists, delete the existing `whatap` repository by using the following command and then proceed with installation.

```shell
helm repo remove whatap
```

### In case there is another namespace named `whatap-monitoring` in the cluster

| Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: Unable to continue with install: Namespace "whatap-monitoring" in namespace "" exists and cannot be imported into the current release |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

If the `whatap-monitoring` namespace exists in the cluster, it is because the user has already installed the Whatap Kubernetes agent based on the *yaml* file. In this case, delete the existing `whatap-monitoring` namespace and related resources by using the following commands.

```shell
kubectl delete namespace whatap-monitoring
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding whatap
kubectl delete clusterrole whatap
```

### In case the `clusterrole` and `clusterrolebinding` resources exist in the cluster

| Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: Unable to continue with install: ClusterRole "whatap" in namespace "" exists and cannot be imported into the current release |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

If the `clusterrole` and `clusterrolebinding` resources already exist in the cluster, delete them by using the following commands.

```shell
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding whatap
kubectl delete clusterrole whatap
```

### In case the `whatap-monitoring` namespace is unavailable {#whatap-monitoring-namespace-unavailable}

By default, the WhaTap Kubernetes agent is installed in the `whatap-monitoring` namespace. However, if the namespace is unavailable or you need to specify a specific namespace, follow the steps below to install the agent in the desired namespace. 

#### Preparation

- **Cart version**: whatap/kube 1.7.11 or later

  Check the chart version by using the following command. 

  ```bash
  helm search repo whatap/kube --versions
  ```

  If the version is less than 1.7.11, update the chart version by using the following command. 

  ```bash
  helm repo update
  ```

- **Helm version**: Helm 3 or later

#### Installation procedure

Install the agent by executing the following command, after entering the namespace to use in `<namespace>`. 

```bash
helm install whatap-kube-agent whatap/kube --create-namespace --namespace <namespace> --set namespaceOverrideEnabled=true --wait -f values.yaml
```

#### Updating and deleting

- **Update**

  Execute the following command to update the agent. 

  ```bash
  helm update whatap-kube-agent whatap/kube --namespace <namespace> --wait
  ```

- **Delete**

  Execute the following command to remove the agent. 

  ```bash
  helm uninstall whatap-kube-agent whatap/kube --namespace <namespace>
  ```

## Troubleshooting issues that occur when starting the agent {#troubleshooting-agent}

<div class ='faq'>

### In case of installation of WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring via an old YAML file

| Unrecognized VM option 'UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap'<br/>Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.<br/>Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit. |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

If you installed WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring via the installation *yaml* downloaded before **August 24, 2022**, you may encounter an error or failure to start the node agent (whatap-node-agent). 

Possible causes are as follows. The installation *yaml* file downloaded before August 24, 2022 contains a node agent launch script using the `UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap` JVM option. 

Starting from WhaTap node agent **1.2.0** (released on November 21, 2022), the JDK used in the agent has been upgraded, and the upgraded JDK version no longer provides the `UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap` option. If you run the node agent 1.2.0 or later with the WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring installed using a *yaml* file downloaded before **August 24, 2022**, the startup fails with the message `Unrecognized VM option 'UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap’`.

#### Solution

To resolve this issue, reinstall the Kubernetes monitoring as follows: 

1. Download the latest *YAML* file by using <Cmdname sid="side_management" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="agentInstall" className="uitext" />

2. Install the agent by using the *yaml* file downloaded from the Kubernetes environment. 

3. Check whether any errors are output during installation in the Kubernetes environment.

4. Make sure the WhaTap monitoring agent Pod is in Running state.

   :::note 

   Check the Kubernetes environment and the <Cmdname sid="side_workload" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="side_podList" className="uitext" /> menu.

   :::

5. Check the logs generated by each monitoring agent through <Cmdname sid="side_management" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="side_kubernetesAgentList" className="uitext" />

### In case the agent is not installed properly due to DockerHub's image pull limit {#troubleshooting-pull-limit}

If you pull images from multiple nodes simultaneously, the installation may fail with an error as follows. If you encounter any problem, reinstall with the following command by changing the image in yaml.

#### Viewing errors

```yaml
kubectl describe pod/<WhaTap k8s agent's Pod name> -n whatap-monitoring
```

#### Lookup result

```yaml
> > Failed to pull image "whatap/kube_mon:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit. Please try again later or log in to increase your rate limit.
```

In this case, change the DockerHub image in the `yaml` file to the public.ecr.aws repository and then reinstall it.

- If you downloaded the default installation yaml from the agent installation screen, you can change the image with the following command. When executing the command, the existing dockerHub image in yaml is replaced with the image of the [public.ecr.aws](http://public.ecr.aws) repository.

  ```yaml
  sed -i 's|image: "whatap/kube_mon|image: "public.ecr.aws/whatap/kube_mon|g' kube_agent.yaml
  ```

## Troubleshooting the application integration issues {#troubleshooting-k8s-application}

### In case the Java monitoring data is not displayed in the container map

Depending on the configuration and management for Cgroups in your Kubernetes environment, you may encounter the issues with obtaining container IDs in specific situations. To address this situation, WhaTap changed the mapping mechanism between the containers and applications for Kubernetes monitoring. This change applies to WhaTap **Kubernetes Agent 1.7.7** and **Java Agent 2.2.42**, and addresses the issue where container IDs are missing due to Cgroups. 

#### Solution

##### Agent Update

To resolve container ID identification issues in the Kubernetes environment, use the latest version that supports accurate identification of data exchanged between the WhaTap Kubernetes agent and APM. Install **Kubernetes Agent** **1.7.7 or later** and **Java Agent** **2.2.42 or later**. 

:::note
Currently only the Java agents are supported, and APMs for other languages are supported in the future. 
:::

##### Configuring additional environment variables

If Java application information does not appear in <Cmdname sid="side_containerMap" className="uitext" /> even after updating the agent version, you can solve the problem by adding user environment variables. This setting adds the `WHATAP_JAVA_AGENT_PATH` option to the container manifest (*yaml*) environment variable where the Java APM has been installed, indicating the absolute path to the Java agent within the container. 

The following is an example of adding the corresponding option to the container environment variables where the Java APM has been installed. 

```YAML
env:
- name: NODE_IP
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
- name: OKIND
  value: {YOUR_OKIND_NAME}
- name: license
  value: <Project Access Key>
- name: whatap.server.host
  value: <collection server IP address>
- name: whatap.micro.enabled
  value: "true"
- name: WHATAP_JAVA_AGENT_PATH
  value: "/whatap/whatap.agent-2.2.35.jar"
```

#### How to check mapping between the container and APM

The following explains how to check that the container and applications are mapped correctly. 

- If any white micro container exists inside the <Cmdname sid="side_containerMap" className="uitext" /> block in <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_containerMap" className="uitext" />, it indicates a normal mapping.

- In <Cmdname sid="side_analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_metricsSearch" className="uitext" />, if the `container` field for the `app_counter` category contains the container ID in which the application is running, the mapping is successful.
