Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_kubeEventList" className="uitext" />

The WhaTap <Cmdname sid="side_kubeEventList" className="uitext" /> menu allows you to perform various queries and searches for Kubernetes events without using commands. You can check the cluster events and also view past events through the time selector. 

<ImgLang img='k8s-kuber-event.png' desc='Kubernetes event'/>

- You can find the desired events through the filtering options and search bar. 

- You can quickly filter by event type, such as <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span> or <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and ***Reason***.

## Event count trend

The ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) <Cmdname sid="TTL06683" className="uitext" /> presented in the bar chart format allows you to visually see the change in the number of events that occurred within the selected time range. 

You can select a desired time zone to view and see the events occurred in the zone. This allows you to quickly identify the time zone when events were concentrated and analyze its details.

## Event list

You can see the list of Kubernetes events that occurred during a specific time period in the ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) area. WhaTap stores the event data up to 30 days, allowing you to view and analyze past events. 

You can also quickly filter desired events by selecting the event type (<span class='slow'>Warning</span>, <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span>), or **_Reason_** at the top of the list.

### Event timeline

It provides all events that occurred from the time the target of the selected event (**_Kind_**) was created to the present in a timeline format. This allows you to see the target's event history at a glance. This provides a comprehensive view for the resource lifecycle, including creation, normal operation, alert generation, and recovery.

### Summary analysis

It provides a summary at a glance so you can see the performance and resource status for the Pod or node where the event occurred.
