- You can find the desired events through the filtering options and search bar. 

- You can quickly filter by event type, such as <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span> or <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and ***Reason***.

## Event count trend

{/* ![지시선 1](/img/number-01.png) <Cmdname sid="TTL06683" className="uitext" />에서 조회한 시간 범위 내의 이벤트 수 추이를 제공합니다. This allows you to effectively trace system issues by pinpointing when events were concentrated. */}

The ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) <Cmdname sid="TTL06683" className="uitext" /> presented in the bar chart format allows you to visually see the change in the number of events that occurred within the selected time range. 

You can select a desired time zone to view and see the events occurred in the zone. This allows you to quickly identify the time zone when events were concentrated and analyze its details.

{/* 조회한 시간 범위의 이벤트 수의 추이를 볼 수 있습니다. The event count trend helps you trace issues by pinpointing when a large number of events occurred. */}

## Event list

You can see the list of Kubernetes events that occurred during a specific time period in the ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) area. WhaTap stores the event data up to 30 days, allowing you to view and analyze past events. 

You can also quickly filter desired events by selecting the event type (<span class='slow'>Warning</span>, <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span>), or **_Reason_** at the top of the list.

### Suggestions

The **_Suggestions_** tab provides insights into the cause of an event and provides directions for tracing the problem based on the event message that occurred.

:::note 

Currently, only the **_BackOff_** event of the <span class='slow'>Warning</span> type is provided as a feature. 

:::

### Adjacent logs

You can see adjacent logs based on the time of occurrence of the selected event. You can set the desired adjacent range by using the time selection button.

:::note 

**Log query role**

- If you have **Log query role**, you can see all adjacent logs.

- If your have no **log query role**, you can view only the adjacent Kubernetes events.

:::

### Event timeline

It provides all events that occurred from the time the target of the selected event (**_Kind_**) was created to the present in a timeline format. This allows you to see the target's event history at a glance.
