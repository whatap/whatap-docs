![Transaction Search](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile.png)

You can search for the desired transaction based on the individual transaction's performance properties.

![Column Selection](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_column.png)

To query the result, click ![Column selection icon](/img/ico-column-set.svg) **_Select Column_** to check.

:::note
It is recommended to set the search time as short as possible because a response delay may occur depending on the search conditions.
:::

## Elapsed Time

![Elapsed Time](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_time.png)

Search is performed based on the transaction response time. Search by entering two values above and below the reference.

## Error Message

![Error Message](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_error.png)

Search is performed based on the transaction error message. In the default state, error-related columns may not be seen. Select a column to check.

## HTTP Call Count

![HTTP call count](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_http.png)

Search based on the number of external HTTP service calls made for transactions.

## SQL Count

![SQL Review](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_sql.png)

Search for transactions where the number of SQL executions per transaction exceeds the set number. Exceptionally, this is used to search transactions that call SQLs excessively.

## SQL Fetch Count

![SQL Patch Count](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_sqlfetch.png)

After executing an SQL, search based on the number of DB patches. The count is based on the transaction. Use this to search transactions that perform excessive data fetches.

## URL

![URL](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_url.png)

Transactions are searched based on the URL. The entered search string is compared and searched by inclusion (partial matching).

## IP

![IP](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_ip.png)

Transactions are searched based on the IP. However, IP strings are searched by prefix comparison (forward matching).

## Domain

![Domain](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_domain.png)

Transactions are retrieved based on the HTTP service domain (host:port). The search conditions must match the domain completely (full match).

## User Agent

![User Agent](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_useragent.png)

Search transactions based on the user agent (partial match). 

## Referer

![Referer](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_referer.png)

Search transactions based on the referer string.

:::note
기본 설정 상태의 에이전트는 Referer 정보를 수집하지 않습니다. Referer 설정이 필요한 경우 다음 문서를 참조해 관련 설정을 추가하세요.

## 트랜잭션 ID

![Transaction ID](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_tid.png)

Search transactions based on their transaction ID (full match). For transaction IDs, the search indexes are created for searching at a high speed.

:::note
If you are not using the latest version of the agent, a full scan may occur rather than using indexes.
:::

## Multi-transaction ID

![Multi Transaction ID](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_mtid.png)

Search transactions based on the multi-transaction ID (full match).

:::note
If you are not using the latest version of the agent, a full scan may occur rather than using indexes.
:::

## Client ID

![Client ID](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_clientid.png)

The client ID (`wClientId`) is an ID given by the WhaTap agent to identify users. Transactions are searched based on this ID (full match). There is no separate index for searching.

## Login ID

![Login ID](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_loginid.png)

Search transactions based on the login ID.

:::note
Agents in their default settings do not collect login IDs. For more information about the login ID setting, see [the following](../java/script-plugin#common-plugin) to add settings.
