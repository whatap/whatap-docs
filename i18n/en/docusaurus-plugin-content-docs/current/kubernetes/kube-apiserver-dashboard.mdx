The kube-apiserver is a component that handles the requests inside and outside the **Control Plane**. After collecting the status and performance metric of kube-apiserver through the **_kube-apiserver dashboard_** menu, you can easily monitor the availability and performance of the cluster by tracing the kube-apiserver's response time, throughput, request failure, and such.

## Basic screen guide

The **_kube-apiserver dashboard_** menu reflects kube-apiserver's key metrics for the last one hour at an interval of 1 minute. You can see the following metrics. For more information about metrics, see the [Metric guide](#kube-apiserever-metric) below.

- To monitor the cluster's load and usage, the status and trends for request counts by method, resource, and response code. 

- The number of API requests being processed is provided to help you understand the cluster load. 

- It provides the number of created OS threads and current goroutines.
