Let's learn about the configuration of the installed agent to monitor applications running in Kubernetes.

## Agent structure

When installing WhaTap Kubernetes, configure resources for agents under the &lt;whatap-monitoring&gt;Namespace in the Kubernetes environment.

The master agent is for Deployment and the node agents are for DaemonSet. The following explains how to check the WhaTap agent installed in the Kubernetes environment.

- **Master Agent**

  ```bash
  kubectl get deployments -n whatap-monitoring 
  kubectl get pods -l=name=whatap-master-agent -n whatap-monitoring
  ```

- **Node Agent**

  ```bash
  kubectl get daemonsets -n whatap-monitoring
  kubectl get pods -l=name=whatap-node-agent -n whatap-monitoring
  ```

The following is an example for the master agent and node agents running in the &lt;whatap-monitoring&gt;namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n whatap-monitoring
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
whatap-master-agent-57f4499567-ltbbr   1/1     Running   0          3d19h
whatap-node-agent-5q8rj                2/2     Running   0          21h
whatap-node-agent-6nb2z                2/2     Running   0          30h
whatap-node-agent-8m2vk                2/2     Running   0          21h
whatap-node-agent-9thmw                2/2     Running   0          3h31m
whatap-node-agent-kpv7d                2/2     Running   0          21h
```

The following is the &lt;whatap-monitoring&gt; namespace displayed on the WhaTap Kubernetes container map.
