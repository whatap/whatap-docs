- When releasing the WhaTap Kubernetes agent, it can be set through the container `env` field. 

- It can be configured by modifying the *whatap.conf* file in the container. 

- The options in the *whatap.conf* file have higher priority than those set in the container `env` field. 

- If no value is set in *whatap.conf* or container `env`, the default value is used.

:::note 

**Setting the application agent options in the container**

Configure necessary settings in *whatap.conf* for monitoring applications such as Java, Python, and Node.js in the container. For more information about available options in *whatap.conf*, see the following links:

- [Configuring Java - whatap.conf](../java/set-agent)

- [Configuring Node.js - whatap.conf](../nodejs/set-agent)

- [Configuring Python - whatap.conf](../python/set-agent)

## Configuring the options for each container

### whatap-node-helper

---

- **collect_volume_detail_enabled** <span class='type'>bool</span>

  Default `true`

  In the node agent, use the `exec df` command for all containers to enable searching the container volume information. It enables the function to collect storage usage and volume data for all containers running on the node.

- **inject_container_id_to_apm_agent_enabled** <span class='type'>bool</span>

  Default `true`

  It enables container ID injection using `exec` in the WhaTap APM container. It automatically extracts the ID of the container identified by the WhaTap APM. You can inject this into the APM tool to associate the performance monitoring data with containers.

- **debug** <span class='type'>bool</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to enable the debugging mode. Set the log level to `DEBUG` when the debugging mode is enabled, otherwise to `INFO`.

- **kube_config_path** <span class='type'>string</span>

  Default `~/.kube/config`

  Specify the Kubernetes configuration file path. If not set, use _~/.kube/config_.

- **log_sys_out** <span class='type'>bool</span>

  Default `true`

  Set the log system output. When the option value is set to `true`, logging is left simultaneously in the standard output (stdOut) and a file. Any changes are immediately reflected in the logging system.

- **collect_kube_node_process_metric_enabled** <span class='type'>bool</span>

  Default `true`

  It is the flag to enable or disable the monitoring for Kubernetes-related processes on the node. If it is set to `true`, monitoring is enabled. If it is set to `false`, monitoring is disabled.

- **collect_kube_node_process_metric_target_list** <span class='type'>list</span> <ScrollToLink anchor='collect_kube_node_process_metric_target_list' />

  Default `"kubelet,containerd-shim,containerd,docker,dockerd,crio,metrics-server, coredns,aws-k8s-agent,kube-proxy"`

  Basically, it monitors Kubernetes-related processes. Users can arbitrarily set the processes to monitor by modifying the process list.

  :::note 

  **List of default monitoring target processes by WhaTab**

  - **kubelet** 

    This controller runs on each node, continuously monitors containers and communicates with the Kubernetes master to make sure that workloads are scheduled and run correctly. It is responsible for checking container status and managing node resources.

  - **containerd** 

    It is a high-performance container runtime for running containers. It handles image management, container creation and execution, networking, and such.

  - **dockerd** 

    It is the main process that manages the creation of Docker containers. This process includes building, releasing, running, networking, and data management for container images.

  - **crio** 

    It is a lightweight container runtime designed for Kubernetes that implements the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to efficiently manage container workloads.

  - **coredns** 

    This process provides DNS services in the Kubernetes cluster and handles name resolution for services in the cluster. It also performs service discovery and load balancing, and supports seamless communication between services in the cluster.

  - **aws-k8s-agent** 

    This agent manages Kubernetes network interfaces (VPC CNI) in the AWS environment. This process allocates and releases AWS network resources (ENIs) for inter-Pod communication. If a problem occurs, it may cause network connection failures or resource allocation errors. 

  - **kube-proxy** 

    This process for routing network traffic is performed in the Kubernetes cluster. This process runs on each node and enables communication between services and Pods. It also uses Linux networking technologies like iptables or IPVS to deliver the cluster's internal requests to the correct Pods. This enables service discovery and load balancing in the Kubernetes cluster.

  - **kube-apiserver**

    This Kubernetes API server is a central component that handles all requests in the cluster and manages the status of resources. It processes all requests in the cluster, including authentication, authorization, and admission control.

  - **etcd**

    It is a distributed key-value database that stores Kubernetes cluster status data. It plays an important role in saving and recovering the status of the cluster.

  - **kube-controller**

    This process manages and runs multiple controllers, maintains the status of cluster resources, and performs automated tasks. It performs various roles such as managing node and Pod status, maintaining replication, etc.

  - **kube-scheduler**

    It places Pods on appropriate nodes in the cluster. It selects an optimal node considering the Pod's requirements and the status of each node.
