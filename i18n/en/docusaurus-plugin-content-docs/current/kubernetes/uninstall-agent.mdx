## Deleting the Kubernetes agent

In the agent installation procedure, check the _YAML_ file name that matches the downloaded Kubernetes version and Container Runtime, and then proceed with the procedure to delete the Kubernetes agent. 

#### YAML file name of the Kubernetes agent

| Docker                                 | YAML file name                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Kubernetes 1.16 or later               | _whatap_kube_1.16.yaml_        |
| Kubernetes 1.16 or later (GPU version) | _whatap_kube_1.16_gpu.yaml_    |
| Below Kubernetes 1.16                  | _whatap_kube.yaml_             |
| Below Kubernetes 1.16 (GPU version)    | _whatap_kube_gpu.yaml_         |

| Containerd                             | YAML file name                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Kubernetes 1.16 or later               | _whatap_kube_containerd_1.16.yaml_        |
| Kubernetes 1.16 or later (GPU version) | _whatap_kube_containerd_1.16_gpu.yaml_    |
| Below Kubernetes 1.16                  | _whatap_kube_containerd.yaml_             |
| Below Kubernetes 1.16 (GPU version)    | _whatap_kube_containerd_gpu.yaml_         |

| CRIO	YAML                              | File name                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Kubernetes 1.16 or later               | _whatap_kube_crio_1.16.yaml_        |
| Kubernetes 1.16 or later (GPU version) | _whatap_kube_crio_1.16_gpu.yaml_    |
| Below Kubernetes 1.16                  | _whatap_kube_crio.yaml_             |
| Below Kubernetes 1.16 (GPU version)    | _whatap_kube_crio_gpu.yaml_         |

### In case the YAML file exists

1. Delete the Kubernetes agent installed with the _YAML_ file name downloaded during the installation procedure. Modify the notation of the following command to your _YAML_ file name, and then run it. 

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f < user's own YAML file name >
   ```

2. If the Kubernetes agent has been deleted successfully, you can see the following: 

   ```bash
   namespace "whatap-monitoring" deleted
   serviceaccount "whatap" deleted
   clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "whatap" deleted
   configmap "node-start-script" deleted
   clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "whatap" deleted
   daemonset.apps "whatap-node-agent" deleted
   configmap "master-start-script" deleted
   deployment.apps "whatap-master-agent" deleted
   service "whatap-master-agent" deleted
   ```

### In case the YAML file does not exist

:::caution 

If you have created custom resources directly in the whatap-monitoring namespace, those resources are deleted also. 

:::

1. Execute the following command to delete the Kubernetes agent. 

   ```bash
   kubectl delete namespace whatap-monitoring
   kubectl delete clusterrolebinding whatap
   kubectl delete clusterrole whatap
   ```

2. If the Kubernetes agent has been deleted successfully, you can see the following:

   ```bash
   namespace "whatap-monitoring" deleted
   clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "whatap" deleted
   clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "whatap" deleted
   ```

### Uninstalling the agent upon installation based on the Helm chart {#uninstall-agent-helm-chart}

Execute the following command to uninstall the WhaTap Kubernetes agent application. 

```bash
# Uninstall release
helm uninstall whatap-kube-agent
```
