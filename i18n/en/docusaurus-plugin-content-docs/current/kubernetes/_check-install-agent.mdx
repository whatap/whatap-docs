## Checking the agent installation

-   If the application agent has been installed successfully, the installation completion message appears as follows:

    <ImgLang img='k8s-app-agent-install-check.png' desc='Checking the Kubernetes agent installation' />

-   To check whether the agent has been installed, go to **_Dashboard_** > **_Application Service Dashboard_**.

    If you have manually installed the downloaded file but cannot see the agent in **_Dashboard_**, check the following.

    -   Execute the command, `ps -ef | grep whatap` in the container, and then check whether the agent options have been applied properly.
    -   Check the content of the container in the _/whatap/logs_ path. Agent logs are output in the format of _logs/`{whatap configuration file name}`-yyyymmdd.log_.
