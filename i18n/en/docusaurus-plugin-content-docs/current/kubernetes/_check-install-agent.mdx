## Checking the agent installation

- To check whether the agent has been installed, go to **_Dashboard_** > **_Application Service Dashboard_**.

- If you have manually installed the downloaded file but cannot see the agent in **_Dashboard_**, check the following.

  - Execute the command, `ps -ef | grep whatap` in the container, and then check whether the agent options have been applied properly.

  - Check the content of the container in the _/whatap/logs_ path. Agent logs are output in the format of _logs/`{whatap configuration file name}`-yyyymmdd.log_.
