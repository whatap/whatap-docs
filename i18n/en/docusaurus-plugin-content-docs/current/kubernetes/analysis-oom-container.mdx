You can quickly search for containers where **Out Of Memory** (**OOM)** has occurred, and check the changes in memory usage (abrupt or gradual) at each time. This allows an objective determination of the eligible number of PODs and the memory thresholds.

:::note

Out Of Memory occurs when a container's memory usage exceeds its limit, or the node on which the container is running encounters an out-of-memory condition. If the container exits with the code 137, it indicates that a SIGKILL has been received by Out Of Memory.
