It is a dashboard that allows you to see the status of applications running inside the container in real time. For normal data output of each widget, the node agent must have been installed in the Kubernetes environment, and the WhaTap agent must also have been installed in the application inside the container.

:::note

- WhaTap agent installation is supported for the applications developed in [Java](../java/dashboard-intro), [Node.js](../nodejs/dashboard-intro), [Python](../python/dashboard-intro), and [PHP](../php/dashboard-intro). 

- You can access it through the **_Dashboard_** menu under **_Dashboard_** or **_Application_**.

:::

<ImgLang img='k8s-ap-service-dashboard.png' desc='Application service dashboard'/>

<Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" /> allows you to collect key metrics of applications through agents, configure charts to monitor the metrics in real time, and view the past data. You can quickly identify and analyze application problems by using the widgets on the dashboard.

In case of general charts excluding CPU and memory, the stable data appears in blue and the elements identified as problems appear in red, making it easy to recognize the current status.

## Application Dashboard

### Viewing the past data

<Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" /> basically provides real-time monitoring features, in which you can view the past data.

|                    Real-time mode                    |                       Non-real-time mode                      |
| :--------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![Real-time mode](/img/apm-timeslector-realtime.png) | ![Non-real-time mode](/img/apm-timeslector-none-realtime.png) |

1. Select ![Pause icon](/img/ico-pause.svg) in the time selector at the upper left of the screen.

2. Click the date and time to set the desired time zone.

   <ImgLang img='apm-timeselector-setting.png' desc='Configure manual time' />

3. Select <Cmdname sid="apply" className="uitext" />.

It updates the data in widgets placed on the dashboard based on the set time. To switch to the Realtime mode, select ![Playback icon](/img/ico-play-time.svg).

### Checking the agent

#### Checking the agent connection status

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-check-agent.png' desc='Agent connection status' />

On the upper left of the screen, the right area of the time selector provides information that allows you to check the status of agents connected to the project. This allows you to immediately check whether the application server is running normally.

- **_Total_**: Number of all agents connected to the project

- **_Active_**: Number of active agents

- **_Inactive_**: Number of inactive agents

- ![Agent display icon](/img/ic-inactive.svg): Can display or hide inactive agents.

#### Agent-based monitoring

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-select-agent.png' desc='Selecting the agent' />

By default, the dashboard displays the metrics collected from all agents in charts and you can also view the data by agent. Select one or more agents under the time selector. The data of the widgets on the dashboard is updated with the metrics of the selected agent(s).

:::tip

To select all agents again while one or more agents is selected, deselect them or select **_Total_**.

:::

:::note

If there are numerous agents connected to the project, it is efficient to set the agent names to be short. For more information about setting the agent name, see [the following](../java/agent-name).

:::

#### Monitoring each classified agents

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-select-agent-by-category.png' desc='Selecting the agent by kind' />

You can select and monitor agents by each group classified through agent settings.

- <Cmdname sid="ITM06005" className="uitext" />: You can select an individual agent or all agents.

- <Cmdname sid="ITM06006" className="uitext" />: Agents can be monitored in each group classified by <code>whatap.okind</code> in the agent configuration.

- <Cmdname sid="ITM06007" className="uitext" />: Agents can be monitored in each group classified by <code>whatap.onode</code> in the agent configuration.

- <Cmdname sid="ITM06008" className="uitext" />: Only the agents classified as <code>whatap.okind</code> in the agent configuration can be monitored.

- <Cmdname sid="ITM06009" className="uitext" />: Only the agents classified as <code>whatap.onode</code> in the agent configuration can be monitored.

### Editing a dashboard widget

The widgets on the dashboard can be adjusted to the desired size and placed in the desired positions. You can also delete unnecessary widgets or add them again.

#### Resizing a widget

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-widget-resize.png' desc='Adjusting the widget size' />

Click and hold the mouse on the ![Resize icon](/img/ic-widget-size.svg) element at the lower right of the widget, and then drag it to the desired size. Grids with a uniform horizontal-to-vertical ratio appear and the size of the widget can be adjusted in each grid.

#### Moving a widget

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-widget-move.png' desc='Moving a widget' />

When you move the mouse cursor to the top of the widget, the cursor shape changes to ![Move icon](/img/ic-move-pointer.svg). At this time, you can move the widget by dragging with your left mouse button and move to the desired position.

#### Deleting a widget

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-widget-remove.png' desc='Deleting a widget' />

Right-click on a widget to delete. If you select <Cmdname sid="delete" className="uitext" />, the widget is deleted from the dashboard.

#### Adding a widget

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-widget-add.png' desc='Adding a widget' />

Move the mouse cursor to an empty space on the dashboard and then right-click on it. Select a widget to add from the pop-up menu. Place the widget to the desired position and then resize it.

:::note

The widgets that can be added are fixed, but we plan to increase supports through future updates.

:::

### Preset

![Preset](/img/apm-dashboard-preset-default.png)

You can save and load the settings and layouts for widgets on the dashboard. The default preset (<Cmdname sid="kube_default" className="uitext" />) cannot be changed, but you can create a new preset by resizing and placing widgets in the desired format.

#### Creating a new preset

1. Place the widgets in the desired format on the dashboard. You can also resize and place only the widgets to be frequently checked.

2. On the upper right of the screen, select ![Save icon](/img/ic-save.svg).

3. Enter a new preset name.

   <ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-preset-save.png' desc='Save Preset' />

   To save the selected agent data, select <Cmdname sid="ITM07345" className="uitext" />.

4. Select <Cmdname sid="save" className="uitext" />.

You can see the newly saved preset from the preset list.

:::note

- If any changes are made to the newly created preset, save the preset again. Select ![Save icon](/img/ic-save.svg) and then save the preset with the same name. Any changes are overwritten in the existing preset.

- If you go to another menu without saving changes on the dashboard, the changes are not saved.

- Presets are saved in your user account and cannot be shared with other users. We plan to update it for better features.

:::

#### Deleting presets

If you have unused presets, you can delete them from the preset list. Select ![Delete icon](/img/ico-remove.svg) on the right of the item to delete from the preset list.

### Using the widget options

The features of the icon displayed on the top of the widget are as follows:

- ![Information icon](/img/ic-info-circle.svg): You can see the features and information for major widgets.

- ![Merge icon](/img/ico-data-merge.svg) <Cmdname sid="TLT06734" className="uitext" />: The agent data for the widget is displayed individually or merged in a graph.

- ![Detail icon](/img/ico-detail.svg) <Cmdname sid="detail" className="uitext" />: A modal window appears where you can search the data of the widgets separately by agent.

:::note

The provided options may differ depending on the widget.

### Learning about widgets

:::info

This document mainly describes the widgets placed on the <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />. For more information about how to analyze transactions and users, services, and resources through <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />, see the following documents:

- [Exploring the Application Dashboard](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard)

- [HITMAP transaction](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-hitmap-class)

- [DB connection delay and connection pool](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dbc)

:::

#### Agent-related widgets

You can see the application information through the agent installed on the application.

#### Transaction-related widget

The failure status that can be checked through the transaction, can be recognized through the priority response time. If a transaction in progress does not end, this should be considered a failure. WhaTap divides sections for display by the time of the progress status. <span class='normal'>Blue (Normal)</span> means transactions within the specified response time, <span class='slow'>Orange (Slow)</span> means slow transactions with the response time of around 8 seconds, and <span class='vslow'>Red (Very slow)</span> means transactions with the response time that is twice as slow as normal. This allows you to intuitively recognize failures as fast as possible.

:::tip

If you add a database project through the <Cmdname sid="side_correlatedProjectManagement" className="uitext" /> menu for the Java platform, you can see the performance metrics of the project linked in the following widget.

- <Cmdname sid="AA001" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="AA002" className="uitext" />: You can view the SQL performance of the database associated with the active transaction.

- <Cmdname sid="AA005" className="uitext" />: You can view performance metrics of the database associated with transactions in the past.

For more information about adding and analyzing the linked project, see [the following](../java/linked-projects).

:::

##### <Cmdname sid="AA001" />

![Active transaction speed](/img/speedmeter.png)

You can see the status of active transactions (middle area) and completed transactions (right area). The water drop icon passing from left to right means a transaction. If you click a chart area, a pop-up window appears where you can see a list of active transactions. If you select one of the transaction lists, you can view the transaction details, SQL query, and call stack information.

- Area on the left

  This indicates the number of requested transactions and displays data in proportion to the number of transactions.

- Area in the middle

  The status of active transactions is color displayed by the speed along with the count at the upper right. The number in the chart is the total number of active transactions. The colors in the chart indicate as follows:

  - Blue (<span class='normal'>Normal</span>): 0 to 3 seconds

  - Orange (<span class='slow'>Slow</span>): 3 to 8 seconds

  - Red (<span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>): 8 seconds or more

- Area on the right

  This indicates the Application Performance Index (Apdex). This metric is measured for customer satisfaction of a web application and has a value between 0 and 1. The droplet flying speed is proportional to the total number of Apdex transactions, and the droplet colors mean as follows:

  - Blue: <span class='normal'>Apdex </span>satisfied count 

  - Orange: <span class='slow'>Apdex </span>tolerating count 

  - Red: <span class='vslow'>Apdex </span>frustrated count = `Total number of APDEX transactions` - (`Apdex satisfied count` + `Apdex tolerating count`)

  :::note

  For more information about the Application Performance Index (Apdex), see [the following link](https://www.apdex.org).

  :::

##### <Cmdname sid="AA002" /> {#active-trs}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-tx.png' desc='Active transaction' />

In the <Cmdname sid="AA002" className="uitext" /> widget, the transactions in progress are displayed in the <b>arc equalizer</b> chart. You can see the status of delays by agent. The arc is divided by the number of agents. By representing the number of requests being processed by the server every 5 seconds, you can tell how long the request has been processed. Requests detected at an interval of 5 seconds are classified by color as follows to determine whether they are dangerous or not.

- Red (<span class='vslow'>Very Slow</span>): 8 seconds or more 

- Orange (<span class='slow'>Slow</span>): 3 to 8 seconds

- Blue (<span class='normal'>Normal</span>): 0 to 3 seconds

The situation where lots of blue colors are represented is not a problem. You must watch the trend to see whether some of them turn to orange or red. In case of a failure, the number of active transactions increases and the percentage of red color increases. On the other hand, a very responsive system with a high number of process transactions (TPS) might have a low number of active transactions.

- On the upper left, the agent name with the most active transactions appears.

- The middle number is a sum of active transactions of all agents.

- Two bars around active transactions rotate around the chart at a three-step rate based on the throughput (TPS).

- When you select a divided arc area, a pop-up window appears listing the transactions in progress on the agent. To check the transaction details, select an item in the transaction list. 

  <ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-tx-popup.png' desc='Transaction List' />

  :::note

  - If the item selected in the transaction list is a transaction that has already ended, select <Cmdname sid="show_trace" className="uitext" />. The <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window appears. For more information about the <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window, see <Link to="../java/trs-profile">the following</Link>.

  - For more information about transactions, see [the following](../java/track-transactions-intro).

  :::

##### <Cmdname sid="AA018" /> {#active-trs-agent}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-tx-agent.png' desc='Agent Active Transaction' />

The <Cmdname sid="AA002" className="uitext" /> widget displays on a chart the data merged based on the criteria selected in the agent selection options. On the other hand, the <Cmdname sid="AA018" className="uitext" /> widget allows you to individually check the agents included in the selected agent classification criteria.

Right-click the dashboard and then select the <Cmdname sid="AA018" className="uitext" /> widget from the widget list.

##### <Cmdname sid="AA004" /> {#active-status}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-active-status.png' desc='Active status' />

All agents in the project collect the active transaction count every 5 seconds, along with the progress status. The progress status is classified into <Cmdname sid="active_stat_method" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="sql" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="active_stat_httpc" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="active_stat_dbc" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="active_stat_socket" className="uitext" />.

- <Cmdname sid="active_stat_method" className="uitext" />: Status in which the method is executing. Normal situations are displayed in blue.

- <Cmdname sid="sql" className="uitext" />: SQL is running. If the <Cmdname sid="sql" className="uitext" /> number increases, check for problems connecting to the database server.

- <Cmdname sid="active_stat_httpc" className="uitext" />: It is calling any external API. If the <Cmdname sid="active_stat_httpc" className="uitext" /> number increases, it means that the server connected to outside is not responding normally.

- <Cmdname sid="active_stat_dbc" className="uitext" />: The transaction is attempting to get a new connection from the connection pool. If DB connection pools are insufficient, a delay occurs whenever a new connection request occurs, causing the performance failure. In this case, the <Cmdname sid="active_stat_dbc" className="uitext" /> number increases.

  :::note

  For more information about the DB connection delay, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dbc).

  :::

- <Cmdname sid="active_stat_socket" className="uitext" />: Indicates the TCP connection attempt to an external system. If the <Cmdname sid="active_stat_socket" className="uitext" /> number continues to increase, there is a high possibility of failures due to disconnection of the external system.

##### <Cmdname sid="AA005" />

<ImgLang img='hitmap.png' desc='Hitmap' />

The <Cmdname sid="AA005" className="uitext" /> chart represents the distribution of response times of completed transactions. The horizontal axis is the transaction end time. The vertical axis is the execution time. Transactions with longer execution times are at the top of the distribution. If you drag the chart area in <Cmdname sid="AA005" className="uitext" />, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" /> window appears that you can see the transaction information details. For more information about <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, see <Link to="dashboard-hitmap-trace">the following</Link>.

- Normal transactions are displayed in light blue → blue → Indigo in order.

- Erroneous transactions are displayed in yellow → orange → red in order.

- The number on the upper right indicates the <span class='normal'>transaction count</span>/<span class='slow'>error count</span> in the chart.

- If <Cmdname sid="yaxis" className="uitext" /> is selected, the Y-axis (execution time) is automatically adjusted.

- If <Cmdname sid="err" className="uitext" /> is selected, only the error transactions appear.

- Select ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg) to zoom in/out the chart from 5 seconds to 80 seconds.

:::note

- The detailed information for the transactions with no error whose execution time is less than 500 ms is collected once every 5 minutes for each URL.

- It does not affect the statistics such as TPS and average response time.

- You can set a policy through the agent configuration. For more information, see [the following](../java/agent-transaction).

- See the following document for the procedure to analyze transactions through the hitmap widget.

:::

#### Service-related widget

The service-related widget can be used as the metric for application performance tuning.

##### <Cmdname sid="tps" />

![TPS](/img/apm-dashboard-tps.png)

**Transaction Per Second** (**TPS**) indicates the number of transactions processed per second and is the reference for service performance metric. The number of transactions processed every 5 seconds is converted to the number of transactions per second and is expressed with a chart. It displays TPS for the last 10 minutes.

:::note

For more information about analyses for TPS, response time, and CPU utilization, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard#analysis-user-service-resource).

:::

##### <Cmdname sid="avg_restime" />

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-avg-response-time.png' desc='Average response time'/>

It monitors the times needed for the application server to return the request result. <Cmdname sid="avg_restime" className="uitext" /> is meaningful as a tuning metric. The WhaTap's monitoring service calculates the average response time for transactions every 5 seconds.

:::note

For more information about analyses for TPS, response time, and CPU utilization, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard#analysis-user-service-resource).

:::

#### Resource-related widget

##### <Cmdname sid="container_cpu" />

<ImgLang img='k8s-ap-service-dashboard-cpu.png' desc='Container CPU' />

It is the container's CPU usage. You can see the change trend in CPU usage in real time.

:::note

For more information about analyses for TPS, response time, and CPU utilization, see [the following](../best-practice-guides/about-apm-dashboard#analysis-user-service-resource).

:::

##### <Cmdname sid="AA010" /> {#heap-memory}

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-heap-memory.png' desc='Heap memory' />

You can see which servers are at risk by displaying the maximum available memory and the current memory for each server. The changes in memory usage over time can be seen in real time.

The memory line chart usually ripples continuously. It increases when using memory to process the requests from the application server. It decreases when memory is cleaned up through GC (Garbage Collection). <Cmdname sid="AA010" className="uitext" /> metric is displayed with average values.

:::note

- Java and Node.js display the total heap memory and usage.

- PHP, Python, and .Net display the process memory usage.

:::

:::tip

For more information about the heap memory and its chart analysis, see the following links.

:::

#### User-related widget

##### <Cmdname sid="realtime_user" />

<ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-realtime-user.png' desc='Concurrent User' />

It displays the number of real-time browser users. Every 5 seconds, users who made transactions within the last 5 minutes are counted and displayed without duplicates. Users are counted based on their browser's IP.

:::note

<InDoc product='java'>

- In the agent settings, the IP or cookies can be used to distinguish users. For more information, see [the following](agent-additional-option).

</InDoc>

- In general, the connected user means a connected user who has access to the current network. However, web systems are different because they use connectionless networks. It does not mean that you are connected, but rather the user who sent the recent request can be measured.

- Real-time (concurrent access) users indicate the users who are using the system in the same time zone. There are various ways to count or measure real-time (concurrent access) users.

- The number of users is calculated by ** HyperLogLog** rather than simply adding up. ** HyperLogLog** is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the number of elements in a set with very little memory.

- For more information about the configuration of agent options for aggregating the user count, see [the following](../java/agent-number-of-user).

:::

#### Comparison widget on a daily basis

:::note

The widgets marked with the `All APPS.` tag display the data for all agents.

:::

##### <Cmdname sid="today_tps" />

<ImgLang img="apm-dashboard-today-tps.png" desc="Today's TPS" />

It displays the TPS for today by hour. You can check it by comparing with the TPS (gray) in the same time zone of yesterday. If you click ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), <Cmdname sid="reportStat" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="daily_app_stat" className="uitext" /> appears.

##### <Cmdname sid="daily_visit" />

<ImgLang img="apm-dashboard-today-users.png" desc="Today's Visits" />

This metric shows the number of <Cmdname sid="realtime_user" className="uitext" /> for the day by time zone. You can check it by comparing with the user count (gray) in the same time zone of yesterday. If you click ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), <Cmdname sid="reportStat" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="daily_app_stat" className="uitext" /> appears.

### Checking the real-time alert

If you select ![Alert Status icon](/img/ico-noti.svg) **Alert Status** on the upper right of the screen, the recent events appear. You can turn on or off the browser notifications by clicking the toggle menu.
