:::note 

**Requirements**

- The WhaTap Kubernetes agent 1.7.16 or later is required. 

- If it is a Kubernetes cluster project (<code class='my'>CP</code>), you can view the corresponding menu.

**etcd** is a core component in the Kubernetes environment that stores the data related to the cluster status. WhaTap provides <Cmdname sid="side_etcdDashboard" className="uitext" /> to monitor the performance and status of etcd. This increases the stability of the cluster and enables a quick response when a problem occurs.

## Basic screen guide

<ImgLang img='k8s-etcd-dashboard.png' desc='etcd dashboard' />

<Cmdname sid="side_etcdDashboard" className="uitext" /> provides key etcd metrics collected over the last one hour at an interval of 1 minute. The key metrics you can see on the dashboard are as follows. For the metrics details, see the [metric guide](#etcd-metrics) at the bottom.

- The resources used by etcd, number of Pod restarts, and log details are provided. 

- The commits and number of applies in etcd are provided. 

- It provides the existence status of etcd leaders and the history of leader changes. 

## Activation of the etcd monitoring

Activate the agent by modifying the downloaded *YAML* file and registering the mTLS certificate when installing the WhaTap Kubernetes agent.

### Checking the certificate and creating the secret

#### Checking the etcd certificate

An mTLS certificate is required for etcd. The etcd certificates are typically stored in the */etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd* path on the control plane node. The file owner is the root account and the required certificates are as follows:

- *ca.crt*

- *server.crt*

- *server.key*

On the machine where the `kubectl` command is executed, check if the certificate exists using the following command. 

```bash
sudo ls /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd
```

#### Creating the secret

If a certificate exists, create a secret with the following command. 

```bash
sudo kubectl create secret generic whatap-etcd-cert -n whatap-monitoring --from-file=ca.crt=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --from-file=server.crt=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --from-file=server.key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
```

When a secret is created successfully, the following message appears. 

```yaml
secret/whatap-etcd-cert created
```

##### In case the root account is unavailable

If you cannot use the `kubectl` command from the root account, see the following instructions. 

1. After copying the certificate, go to the accessible path. 

2. Change the owner of the duplicated certificate file to the current owner. 

##### In case there is no namespace

If you create a secret before applying the Kubernetes agent YAML, the secret creation may fail because the `whatap-monitoring` namespace does not exist. After creating the namespace, create a secret again with the following command.

```bash
kubectl create namespace whatap-monitoring
```

### Modifying the WhaTap Kubernetes agent *YAML*

Modify the WhaTap Kubernetes agent *YAML* file to add container settings and then attach the secret.

#### Configuring the container

1. Add the etcd-related settings to the args section in the `whatap-control-plane-helper` container of Deployment. 

   ```yaml
   -collect_etcd_monitoring_enabled=true
   -etcd_hosts=user_etcd_ip, user_etcd_ip
   ```

   See the following example: 

   ```yaml title='Example'
   -etcd_hosts=192.168.1.45,192.168.1.46,192.168.1.47
   ```

2. Add the following to the environment variables (env) of the `whatap-master-agent` container of Deployment. 

   ```yaml
   - name: "collect_etcd_monitoring_enabled"
     value: "true"
   ```

#### Connecting the secret

1. Add a secret to the volumes section in `whatap-master-agent` of Deployment. 

   ```yaml {3}
   - name: "whatap-etcd-cert"
     secret:
       secretName: "whatap-etcd-cert"
   ```

2. Mount the secret into the `whatap-control-plane-helper` container. 

   ```yaml {2}
   volumeMounts:
     - name: "whatap-etcd-cert"
       readOnly: true
       mountPath: "/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd"
   ```
