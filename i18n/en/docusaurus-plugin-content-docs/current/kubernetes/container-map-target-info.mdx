### Container summary analysis and Pod summary analysis {#kube-resource-summary-analysis}

<Cmdname sid="TTL08230" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="TTL08317" className="uitext" type="kube_pod"/> provides analysis reports on the performance and resources for each container and Pod in the Kubernetes environment. You can monitor the resource allocation and usage for containers and Pods in the clusters and namespaces in real time and respond effectively by referencing the suggestions of the reports.

:::note 

Currently, each summary analysis is available only in Korean.

#### Container summary analysis {#container-summary-analysis}

- Basic information: It provides information about the container's startup time, restart count, and the affiliated Pod and namespace.

- Container image: You can see how many containers are using the same container image as the one in use, and their total resource usage.

- Node Information: It provides hardware information about the node where the container is running, such as OS, IP address, number of CPU cores, and memory size.

- Resource usage: It provides the CPU and memory usage of the container and their utilization compared to the configured limit and request values.

#### Pod summary analysis {#pod-summary-analysis}

import PodSummary from "../common-items/_import_k8s-pod-summary-analysis.mdx";
