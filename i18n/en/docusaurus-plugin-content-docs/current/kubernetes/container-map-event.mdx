It provides records for all events that occur during the resource lifecycle. The events provided in WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring are as follows.

-   Kubernetes Event (**_Kubernetes_**)
-   WhaTap event (**_WhaTap_**)

## Basic screen guide

![Kubernetes Display Detail Event tab](/img/k8s-event-default2.png)

-   By selecting a ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) Kubernetes event or WhaTap event, you can see the event details. 

    -   Selecting all or multiple blocks

        You can search **_All Kubernetes events_** or **_All WhatTap events_** when all or multiple blocks are selected from **_Container Map_** and the card on the left.

    -   Selecting clustering or individual block

        When selecting **_Step 2_** grouping or individual block at the top of **_Container Map_**, you can view the event. For more information about **grouping** (clustering), see [the following](container-group).

        :::note

        Before entering the **Display Detail** screen, depending on the view or grouping selected at the top of **_Container Map_**, the events that can be viewed may differ.

        :::

-   Through the ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) time selector, you can set the time zone to view. The default value is **_1 day_**.

-   Through the ![number 3](/img/number-03.png) bar chart, you can see the **_Trend of number of events_** in the selected time zone.

-   Through the ![number 4](/img/number-04.png) event list, you can see the event records. 

    -   **_Kubernetes_** events

        -   You can see the data by selecting a desired event type: <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span> or <span class='slow'>Warning</span>. These event types are identical to the event types provided by Kubernetes.

        -   The bars on the left of each event indicate the event types. Gray means <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span>, and orange means <span class='slow'>Warning</span>.

    -   **_WhaTap_** events

        -   Select a desired event level to search among <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>, <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, and <span class='slow'>Warning</span>.

        -   The bars on the left of each event indicate the event levels. Gray indicates <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, orange <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and red <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>.

## Kubernetes event

**_Kubernetes_** events are provided by Kubernetes itself. In the Kubernetes environment, you can use the `kubectl get events` command to get the event data of the Kubernetes cluster.

```bash

$ kubectl get events -A

However, the event data is not stored continuously. The events that occurred after a specified time are no longer available. 

WhaTap Kubernetes collects and stores all Kubernetes events that occurred in the user cluster environment. Event data such as pod, ReplicaSet, deployment, and namespace is provided according to the target to check.

The bars on the left of each event indicate the event types. Gray means <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span>, and orange means <span class='slow'>Warning</span>. The Kubernetes events provided by user selection are as follows.

Kubenetes events stored in WhaTap consists of `message`, `namespace`, `kind`, `name`, `reason` and `type`.

## WhaTap event

**_WhaTap_** events occur depending on the event conditions registered by the event configuration. Under the **_Event_** tab on the detailed view screen of **_Container Map_**, you can see the list of events based on the WhaTap alert settings. 

![WhaTap event](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_kubernetes_container_map_event_whatap.png)

The bars on the left of each event indicate the event levels. Gray means <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, orange <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and red <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>. Available WhaTap events according to the selected target are as follows.

| Selected target  | Provided event                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| All              | All project events                                          |
| Namespace        | All events under the namespace                              |
| Node             | `onodeName` is identical to the user node name              |
| Deployment       | `deployment` is identical to the Deployment name            |
| ReplicaSet       | `replicaSetName` is identical to the user ReplicaSet name   |
