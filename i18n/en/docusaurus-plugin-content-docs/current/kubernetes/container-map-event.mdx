It provides records for all events that occur during the resource lifecycle. The events provided in WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring are as follows.

-   Kubernetes Event (**_Kubernetes_**)
-   WhaTap event (**_WhaTap_**)

## Basic screen guide

![Kubernetes Display Detail Event tab](/img/k8s-event-default3.png)

-   You can select a ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) Kubernetes event (**_Kubernetes_**) or WhaTap event (**_WhatTap_**) for query. 

    -   Selecting all or multiple blocks

        You can search **_All Kubernetes events_** or **_All WhatTap events_** when all or multiple blocks are selected from **_Container Map_** and the card on the left.

    -   Selecting clustering or individual block

        When selecting **_Step 2_** grouping or individual block at the top of **_Container Map_**, you can view the event. For more information about **grouping** (clustering), see [the following](container-group).

        :::note

        Before entering the **Display Detail** screen, depending on the view or grouping selected at the top of **_Container Map_**, the events that can be viewed may differ.

        :::

-   Using the ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) time selector, you can set the time zone to view event records in. The default value is **_1 day_**.

-   The **_event number trend_** in the ![number 3](/img/number-03.png) selected time zone can be viewed with a bar chart. 

-   In the ![number 4](/img/number-04.png) list format, you can see the event records. 

    -   If you select **_Hide Tag_** on the upper right of the event record list, you can see the **_timestamp_** and **_message_** excluding the tags while recording events.

    -   **_Kubernetes_** events

        -   You can see the data by selecting a desired event type: <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span> or <span class='slow'>Warning</span>. These event types are identical to the event types provided by Kubernetes.

        -   The bars on the left of each event indicate the event types. Gray means <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span>, and orange means <span class='slow'>Warning</span>.

    -   **_WhaTap_** events

        -   Select a desired event level to search among <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>, <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, and <span class='slow'>Warning</span>.

        -   The bars on the left of each event indicate the event levels. Gray indicates <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, orange <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and red <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>.

## Kubernetes event

**_Kubernetes_** events are provided by Kubernetes itself. In the Kubernetes environment, you can use the `kubectl get events` command to get the event data of the Kubernetes cluster.

```bash

$ kubectl get events -A

However, the event data is not stored continuously. The events that occurred after a specified time are no longer available. 

WhaTap Kubernetes collects and stores all Kubernetes events that occurred in the user cluster environment. Event data such as pod, ReplicaSet, deployment, and namespace is provided according to the target to check.

![Kubernetes events](/img/k8s-container-event-k8s-all.png)

The bars on the left of each event indicate the event types. Gray means <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span>, and orange means <span class='slow'>Warning</span>. The Kubernetes events provided by user selection are as follows.

| Selected target      | Provided event                                                                  | Provision-related event                                                                              |

| Deployment           | ① `kind` is Deployment② <br/>`name` is identical to the user deployment name    | `name` starts with the user deployment name.                                                         |
| ReplicaSet           | ① `kind` is ReplicaSet.② <br/>`name` is identical to the user's ReplicaSet name | `name` starts with the user ReplicaSet name.                                                         |
| Pod (container)      | ① `kind` is Pod② <br/>`name` is identical to the user pod name                  | The pod starts with the name of the deployment to which the pod belongs or with the ReplicaSet name. |

Kubenetes events stored in WhaTap consists of `message`, `namespace`, `kind`, `name`, `reason` and `type`.

## WhaTap event

**_WhaTap_** events occur depending on the event conditions registered by the event configuration. Under the **_Event_** tab on the detailed view screen of **_Container Map_**, you can see the list of events based on the WhaTap alert settings.

![WhaTap events](/img/k8s-container-event-wt-all.png)

The bars on the left of each event indicate the event levels. Gray means <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, orange <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and red <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>. Available WhaTap events according to the selected target are as follows.

| Selected target | Provided event                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| All             | All project events                                        |
| Namespace       | All events under the namespace                            |
| Node            | `onodeName` is identical to the user node name            |
| Deployment      | `deployment` is identical to the Deployment name          |
| ReplicaSet      | `replicaSetName` is identical to the user ReplicaSet name |
| Pod             | `podName` is identical to the user pod name               |
| Container       | `containerId` is identical to the user Container ID       |

WhaTap events consist of the items such as `message`, `status`, `title`, and `level`. The following example screen displays the **_WhatTap Container Event_** records.

![Kubernetes WhaTap Event sc](/img/k8s-container-event-wt.png)

-   From the summary information card on the left of ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) **Display Detail**, select a target to view.

-   From the ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) summary information list, check the information of the selected one.

-   In the ![number 3](/img/number-03.png) **_Event_** tab, select a **_WhaTap_** event. 

    > Before entering the **Display Detail** screen, you can view **_container events_** by setting the option at the top of **_Container map_** to Container view.

-   Through the ![number 4](/img/number-04.png) time selector, select a time to view. The default value is **_1 day_**.

-   Through the ![number 5](/img/number-05.png) bar chart, see the **_Trend of number of events_** in the specified time zone.

    > If you look at the trend of event counts on a daily basis from 8:57 on July 10th to 8:57 on July 11th, you can see that two events were counted at 8:48 on the 11th. 

-   From the ![number 6](/img/number-06.png) event history, check the information of event records. You can see the levels for each event through the bars on the left of the list. To check all event messages and tags, select the ![Down arrow icon](/img/ic-caret-down.svg) icon.

    > In the event record list, you can view for two <span class='slow'>Warning</span> level events: `CPU utilization of 85% or more by the container limit` and `GC count or more`.
