## SSL authentication-related issues

If you encounter the following SSL security issues when connecting to the database from agents, set the option not to use SSL authentication when connecting JDBC.

```txt
com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.

com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: "enctyp1" property is set to "true" and "trustServerCertificate" property is set to "false" but the driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by ising Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption
```

Set the following option in the agent configuration file (*whatap.conf*) to disable SSL authentication:

```ini title="whatap.conf"
connect_option=?encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=true
```
