## Agent deletion

### Deleting from the server where the agent have been installed

Among Java processes running on the server, it terminates the processes that contain the string, `whatap.agent.dmx`. Run *stop.sh* from the path where you installed the agent. Afterwards, delete the agent file and user permission registered in the agent.
