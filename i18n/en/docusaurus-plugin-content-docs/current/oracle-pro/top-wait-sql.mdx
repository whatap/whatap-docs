Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_statistics" className="uitext" /> &gt; **Top SQL by Wait**

**Top SQL by Wait** focuses on quickly identifying SQL tuning priorities. You can visually confirm the Wait Class and Wait Event with the most wait time during a specific time period through charts and tables, and compare execution count and average time in the Top SQL table.

## Basic Screen Guide

<ImgLang img="db-top-wait-sql.png" desc="top wait sql" />

## Wait Class Chart

Clicking a class in the chart or legend will apply it as a filter. Clicking again will remove the filter.

- The Wait Class bar chart at the top visually displays the proportion of total wait time during the selected analysis period.

- The selected filters are shown as tags.

### Wait Event List

If no class is selected, the most frequent events within the selected time range are displayed. When a Wait Class filter is applied, the event list for that class is shown.

When a **Wait Event** is selected from the list, it is added as a filter to the **SQL List**.

### Wait / System Stat Trends

Visually displays the distribution of Wait Classes and session counts over time. You can identify spikes in wait events by time range. Analysis categories include: Wait(time), Wait(count), Latch, Enqueue, Stat, Cpu, Memory, Session Count.

### SQL List

Key execution performance metrics are displayed for each SQL item, including Elapsed Time, CPU Time, Wait Time, Execute Count, and Logical Reads, enabling quick comparison and analysis.

- **Default (no filters selected)**: Displays the top 50 queries by Elapsed Time.

- **When a class is selected**: Displays the top 50 queries by Wait Time for the selected class.
