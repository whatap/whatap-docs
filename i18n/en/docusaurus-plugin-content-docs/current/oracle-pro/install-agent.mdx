## Checking the configuration diagram

It is the configuration to install the agent on the database server for Oracle Pro monitoring.

<ImgLang img='dbx-install-agent-on-db-server-dma.png' desc='' />

Firewall settings are required and all data is transmitted encrypted. The port 6600 is used for communication with the WhaTap collection server.

import Dbcreatemonitoringaccount from "../common-items/_db-create-monitoring-account.mdx";

<Dbcreatemonitoringaccount />

- In general cases

  ```sql title="SQL"
  create user whatap identified by DB_Password;
  grant create session to whatap;
  grant select any dictionary to whatap;
  ```

- Multi-tenant in 12c or later: Add the prefix `c##`.

  ```SQL title="SQL"
  create user c##whatap identified by DB_Password;
  grant reate session to c##whatap;
  grant select any dictionary to c##whatap;
  alter user c##whatap set container_data = ALL container = CURRENT;
  ```

- In case of using the kill session

  ```SQL title="SQL"
  grant alter system to whatap;
  ```

import Accesskey from "../getting-started/_accesskey-v2.mdx";

<Accesskey />

## Download agent

On the agent Installation screen, select the Oracle version that matches your environment and then select <Cmdname sid="download" className="uitext" />.

:::note

For users who cannot download tar files due to security settings, ZIP files are also provided. On the installation screen, select the <UI>.zip</UI> <Cmdname sid="download" className="uitext" /> button.

:::

## Agent CONFIG.

The agent is recommended to be installed with an Oracle account and the Oracle connection environment variables must have been set. Proceed with the agent configuration in the following order.

:::note

**In case of installation from the user account other than the Oracle account**

- You need the role (`read`) to read the shared memory created by Oracle.

- If the `perms` value is 600 in the result of executing the `ipcs -m` command, installation is possible only with the Oracle account.

- If the `perms` value is 640 in the result of executing the `ipcs -m` command, other accounts belonging to the same group can also perform installation.

:::

### whatap.conf configuration {#setting-whatapconf}

Go to the unzipped folder and then check the *whatap.conf* file. In *whatap.conf*, enter the project access key, WhaTap server data, and `ipckey`.  

```ini title='whatap.conf'
license={AccessKey}
whatap.server.host=13.124.11.223/13.209.172.35 # WhaTap server information
ipckey={ipckey}
```

:::tip

- The `ipckey` option value can be acquired via the `ipcs -m` command. This is the key value (hexadecimal) of the Oracle to be monitored.

- If you have installed multiple databases on a server, see [the following](check-ipckey) to enter the `ipckey`.

:::

### Creating the initial configuration file {#createinitialsettingfile}

To create an initial configuration file, connect to the database with the **SYS** account (or an equivalent account) to receive and process information. The account and password are not saved.

```sh title="BASH"
./dmxinit.sh {sys_user} {sys_password}
```

After execj\uting the command, the following five files are created:

> *dmx.init*, *class.init*, *dbname.init*, *stat.init*, *event.init*

:::note

- If you can connect without `sys_user` and `sys_password` (as connecting with `sqlplus '/as sysdba'`), you do not need to add `sys_user` and `sys_password` as arguments.

  ```sh title="BASH"
  ./dmxinit.sh
  ```

- If the `sys_user` and `sys_password` strings contain special characters, add the escape character (`\`) before each special character.

  ```sh title="BASH"
  ./dmxinit.sh whatap whatap\!\@pwd
  ```
