The ANR Statistics menu is a dashboard for analyzing and monitoring ANR (Application Not Responding) events in Android apps.  
An ANR is a critical performance issue that occurs when an app does not respond to user input for more than 5 seconds.  
The top section provides a common time range selector and filtering features.

- **Time Range**: Select a range from the last 5 minutes up to 7 days  
- **Filters**: Filter by screen, device, app version, etc.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Elapsed time and frequency analysis at ANR occurrence
