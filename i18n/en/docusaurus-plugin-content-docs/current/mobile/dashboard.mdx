The dashboard provides a view to monitor user experience and performance of mobile applications.  
You can check both real-time and historical data, and view statistics from various perspectives such as device, OS, and region.  
It also shows screen load events and HTTP request performance data, allowing you to quickly identify performance issues.

## App Startup Time

Displays the average time of each step in the overall app startup performance.  
The timeline bar chart visualizes the startup process step by step, making it easy to see where delays occur.

> This metric is available **for Android only**.

## Screen Load Count

Displays the total number of screen loads based on the current view time.  
This helps you identify when users are most active and determine peak traffic times.

- Sudden increase: Possible effect of marketing campaigns or push notifications  
- Decrease: Possible app performance issues or server failures  

## Screen Heatmap

Displays a distribution chart of screen load response times by time of day.  
Drag the chart area to view detailed screen event information for that period.

- **X-axis**: Screen load end time  
- **Y-axis**: Screen load response time  
- **Color**: Light blue → Blue → Navy to represent normal event density  

## Average Screen Load Time

Monitors the average load time per screen in real time, helping identify screens that need optimization.  
The bottom table provides detailed data by screen class, enabling quick detection of slow screens for optimization.

- **Top of widget**: Line chart showing screen load times by screen over the last 10 minutes  
- **Bottom of widget**  
  - Left: Average screen load time  
  - Right: Bar chart of screen class call counts, sorted by frequency  

## Today's Session Count

Displays the total number of sessions that occurred during the day in real time.  
You can compare with the same time on the previous day to analyze app usage trends and user activity patterns.

- **Top of widget**: Shows total sessions from midnight to the current time and compares with previous day sessions  
- **Bottom of widget**: Graph of real-time sessions measured at 5-minute intervals  
  - Today’s sessions: Blue area  
  - Previous day’s sessions: Gray area  

## HTTP Heatmap

Provides a heatmap chart of HTTP request response times generated by the app.  
Request details can also be checked in the table.

- **X-axis**: HTTP request end time  
- **Y-axis**: HTTP response time  
- **Normal requests**: Light blue → Blue → Navy  
- **Error requests**: Yellow → Orange → Red (HTTP 400+)  

## Average HTTP Response Time

Provides average HTTP response times by API endpoint.  
This allows you to easily identify the most frequently called APIs and the slowest ones for optimization.

- **Top of widget**: Line chart of HTTP response times by API over the last 10 minutes  
- **Bottom of widget**  
  - Left: Average response time per API  
  - Right: Bar chart of API call counts, sorted by frequency  

## HTTP Request Failures

Aggregates HTTP errors (status code 400+) and request cancellations.  
Monitor time-based failure trends to detect server or network issues.

* Analyze error occurrence patterns by time
    - Identify server failure times  
    - Detect unstable network segments  
    - Evaluate API endpoint reliability  

## Crash Status by Device

Displays the number of crashes by device model.  
Helps identify compatibility issues by detecting recurring crashes on specific models.  

- Tracked information
    - Device model  
    - OS version (Android, iOS)  
    - Memory and storage status  
    - Crash frequency  

## Crashes by Exception Type

Classifies and displays crashes by Exception/Error type, helping you identify code vulnerabilities.  

- Android crash types
    - NullPointerException  
    - OutOfMemoryError  

- iOS crash types
    - NSInvalidArgumentException  
    - NSRangeException  
    - EXC_BAD_ACCESS  
    - Swift Error types  

## Crashes by Screen

Displays crashes by screen.  
Helps identify frequently crashing screens to prioritize stability improvements.

- Collected information at crash
    - Screen name and class  
    - Crash occurrence time  
    - User action context  

## ANR by Screen

Displays the number of ANRs (Application Not Responding) by screen.  
Helps identify which screens have concentrated ANR events that significantly affect user experience.

> This metric is available **for Android only**.
