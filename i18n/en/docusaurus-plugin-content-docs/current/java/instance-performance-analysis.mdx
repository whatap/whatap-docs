## Analyzing the thread dump {#thread-details}

It guides you to the information that can be checked in the <Cmdname sid="thread_list" className="uitext" /> tab.

### Thread status {#stateofthread}

The states of the thread are declared as enumerated types named `State` in the `java.lang.Thread` class.

- `NEW`: The thread has been generated but not run.

- `RUNNABLE`: The CPU has been occupied and the tasks are being performed. The resource allocation by the OS may result in `WAITING` state.

- `WAITING`: It is waiting using the `wait()`, `join()`, and `park()` methods.

- `TIMED_WAITING`: It is waiting using the `sleep()`, `wait()`, `join()`, and `park()` methods. The difference from the `WAITING` state is that it is waiting for a given time. The waiting state can be released by the time as well as external environment change.

- `BLOCKED`: It is waiting for the locked object to be released.

- `TERMINATED`: Execution has been completed.

### Thread dump information

You can check the thread dump information by selecting the <LinkImage img="ico-expander-black.svg" className="ico black" /> button for each thread in the thread list.
