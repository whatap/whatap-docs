## In case CPU metrics are displayed as -1 {#cpumetrics}

When running IBM Java in the environment with the latest version of the Java agent, the CPU metrics may sometimes be displayed as **-1**. This issue occurs because the **System Load Average** value is not supported on specific platforms.

The Java agent basically uses the Java Management Extensions (JMX) to collect metrics. It uses the `getSystemLoadAverage()` method of the `OperatingSystemMXBean` interface. This method returns the average load of the system over the last minute depending on the operating system. However, some platforms do not support this value and may return **-1**.

:::info

The `getSystemLoadAverage()` method can be checked in the OpenJDK source code. For example, the source code for the OpenJDK 7u version can be seen in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openjdk-mirror/jdk7u-jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/lang/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.java).

:::

### Recommendation: Configure metric collection via built-in libraries.

To resolve the CPU metrics displayed as **-1**, enable the built-in library (OSHI or SIGAR) via the Java agent settings.

- **Java 8 or later**: Use the **OSHI** library.

  You can use the **OSHI** library to reliably collect operating system level metrics. See the following how to configure the agent.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  # default false
  oshi_enabled=true
  ```

- **Below Java 8**: Use the **SIGAR** library.

  For environments below Java 8, you can collect metrics via the **SIGAR** library. For more information on how to configure the agent, see the following.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  # default false
  sigar_enabled=true
  ```

:::caution

The **OSHI** (`oshi_enabled`) and **SIGAR** (`sigar_enabled`) options are disabled by default. They must be explicitly set if needed.

- Be careful not to enable both settings at the same time. Select a library that best suits your environment and then configure it.
