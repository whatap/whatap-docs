title: Agent name identification
description: To identify monitoring targets, the method how to set a unique identifier for the application server is provided. It is required to identify application servers among the monitoring target systems. You can see automatic naming based on the data such as server type and IP. Otherwise, you can manually set the agent name through the whatap.conf file or JVM options.

## How to determine the default name

If there is no setting for `whatap.oname` as an JVM option, agent names are automatically assigned in the following priority.

1. `whatap.type` is identified.
2. When `whatap.type` is a servlet container, the port used by the application is identified.
3. If the port cannot be identified, the process ID (PID) is retrieved.
4. By adding the third and fourth IPv4 addresses to the identified information, the final name is determined.

For example, if **Tomcat** is started with the port **8080** on a server whose IP address is 10.11.**12**.**13**, the agent name is automatically assigned with `TC-12-13-8080`.

## Variable of the agent name

Available name variables are as follows:

| Variable | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| String   | The entered string is used.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `{type}` | The container type is automatically identified and assigned. <br/> Targets to be identified automatically: JAVA, TOMCAT, JBOSS, RESIN, SPRINGBOOT, JETTY, JEUS, WEBLOGIC, WEBSPHERE, UNDERTOW, PLAY |
| `{ip0}`  | The first byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **10** in **10**.11.12.13)                                                                                                                        |
| `{ip1}`  | The second byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **11** in 10.**11**.12.13)                                                                                                                       |
| `{ip2}`  | The third byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **12** in 10.11.**12**.13)                                                                                                                        |
| `{ip3}`  | The fourth byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **13** in 10.11.12.**13**)                                                                                                                       |
| `{pid}`  | The process ID (PID) of Java is used.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `{port}` | The port that the application listens to is used.                                                                                                                                                   |

## Setting the agent name

Instead of the name that has been automatically assigned, you can enter the name by adding the JVM option into the startup script.

<div class="c4-name">

| Option           | Setting location   | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-Dwhatap.name`  | JVM Options        | Set the agent name as a pattern. <br/>default: `{type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{port}`                                                                                              |
| `-Dwhatap.oname` | JVM Options        | Set the agent name to a fixed value. If the <br/>`-Dwhatap.oname=java-sales-01` <br/> option is not set, the pattern set in the `-Dwhatap.name` option is applied.<br/> |

</div>

:::tip

In the environment where the IP address is 10.11.12.13 and the port number is 8000,

- **In case the -Dwhatap.oname option** is not applied: **whatap.oname** defaults to `JAVA-12-13-8000` according to the pattern set in `-Dwhatap.name`.

- **In case the -Dwhatap.oname option is applied**: The `-Dwhatap.name` option is ignored and the agent name is applied as the value set in the `-Dwhatap.oname` option.

:::

:::note

- In the scale out environment of the cloud, VM can be copied and used. Thus, it is important that object names are automatically assigned.
- If two VPC environments have been created and the network has been set to use the same private IP, the two VPCs must not be duplicated. For example, it can be separated as another project or the `-Dwhatap.name` option can be set by combining the name variables in different ways.

:::

The following options can be applied as an agent name to *whatap.conf*.

import Javaagentname from "../common-items/_java-agent-name.mdx";

<Javaagentname />

<OkindNodename />
