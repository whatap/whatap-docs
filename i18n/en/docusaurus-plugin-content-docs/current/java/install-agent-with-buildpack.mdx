If you are building an executable Docker image with the Java application using Gradle, you can use the buildpack to install the agent. 

## Basic settings of the WhaTap buildpack

```java title='build.gradle'
tasks.named("bootBuildImage") {
	buildpacks = ["urn:cnb:builder:paketo-buildpacks/java",	
								"docker.io/whatap/paketo-buildpack-apm"]
}
```

## Configuring options

Only when the WhaTap collection server is connected, data can be collected. The access key (`accesskey`) and WhaTap collection server address (`whatap.server.host`) are required. Additional options can be set according to the needs for the environment and functions.

```java title='build.gradle'
tasks.named("bootBuildImage") {
  // Whatap 
  environment["BP_WHATAP_ENABLED"] = "true"
  // java 17, There must be a space at the beginning.
  environment["BPE_APPEND_JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"] = " --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED "
  // add multi options, delimeter is linefeed character
  environment["BP_WHATAP_OPTIONS"] = "accesskey=aaa-bbb-ccc\nwhatap.server.host=1.1.1.1/2.2.2.2"

  buildpacks = ["urn:cnb:builder:paketo-buildpacks/java",	"docker.io/whatap/paketo-buildpack-apm"]
}
```

-   `BP_WHATAP_ENABLED`

    Set whether or not to enable the WhaTap agent. If the value is `false`, installation is performed but started with monitoring stopped. You can change it to `true` in **_Management_**> **_Agent CONF._** in [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io) later.

-   `BPE_APPEND_JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`

    If Java 17 is used, be sure to add the JVM option.

    ```java
    environment["BPE_DELIM_JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"] = " "
    environment["BPE_APPEND_JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"] = "--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED"
    ```

    Add spaces before and after if you are not using the delimiter environment variable.

    ```java
    environment["BPE_APPEND_JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"] = " --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED "
    ```

-   `BP_WHATAP_OPTIONS`

    You can add the WhaTap agent settings. Set options with linefeed "\\n" as the delimiter. The option is `key=value`. The set option values are saved in the `whatap.conf` file during the Docker Image creation step. 

    ```java
    environment["BP_WHATAP_OPTIONS"] = "accesskey={access key}\nwhatap.server.host={collection server address}"
    // Example: environment["BP_WHATAP_OPTIONS"] = "accesskey=aaa-bbb-ccc\nwhatap.server.host=1.1.1.1/2.2.2.2"
    ```

## Tomcat 10 environment

In the Tomcat environment, the `weaving=tomcat10` option must be added.

```java
environment["BP_WHATAP_OPTIONS"] = "accesskey={access key}\nwhatap.server.host={collection server address}\nweaving=tomcat10"
```

## Container execution option

When running the container, you can set the access key and WhaTap collection server address as environment variables as follows.

```docker
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 
  -e accesskey={access key} 
  -e whatap.server.host={collection server address} 
  -e weaving=tomcat10,webflux-6.0 
  spring-boot-gradle-hello-world-pcketo-buildpack-whatap
```
