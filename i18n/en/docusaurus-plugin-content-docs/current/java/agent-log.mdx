The following explains how to manage log data generated in the Java application environment through the agent. It includes the configuration of the path and name of the log file, retention period setting, log monitoring, and how to enable custom log tracing. It also provides various options for log management to help manage system logs efficiently.

## Setting the path and name

The path and name of the agent log can be set in *whatap.conf*. The default value of `log_root` is the _`${WHATAP_HOME}`/logs_ path.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
log_root=whatap/logs
log_name=whatap
```

## Log management options

By writing the log-related options in *whatap.conf*, you can manage the log content.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
watchlog_enabled=true
log_rotation_enabled=true
log_oname_enabled=true
log_keep_days=7
```

- **watchlog_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  If the value is `true`, the log monitoring is enabled.

- **watchlog_check_interval** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `2000`

  It is the interval for monitoring the logs. At every interval, it checks whether any record has been added to the log file.

- **watchlog_read_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `8`

  It is the maximum count to read logs. It reads as many as `watchlog_buffer_size` at a time.

- **watchlog_buffer_size** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `131072(128k)`

  Size for reading logs at a time.

- **watchlog.LOGKEY**

  This is the setting to monitor a log file. Enter the `file` name and set multiple `words` with the delimiter, comma (,). It watches the logs at `check_interval` and alerts you when any keywords are found. Once an alert has occurred, the occurrence of alert stops for the `silent` period.

  - **watchlog.LOGKEY.enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span> Default `true`
  - **watchlog.LOGKEY.file** <span class='type'>String</span>
  - **watchlog.LOGKEY.words** <span class='type'>String</span>
  - **watchlog.LOGKEY.silent** <span class='type'>Int</span> Default `10000`
  - **watchlog.LOGKEY.check_interval** <span class='type'>Int</span> Default `1000`

- **log_root** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `${WHATAP_HOME}`/logs

  Set the agent's log path.

- **log_datasource_lookup_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  The function to record the log is activated in case of DataSource upon InitialContext Lookup.

- **log_rotation_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  The function to store agent log files by date is activated. The log file name is stored in the format of _whatap-'yyyymmdd'.log_. If the value is `false`, the log file name is stored in the format of _whatap.log_.

- **log_keep_days** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `7`

  It sets the log file retention period. It works only when the `log_rotation_enabled` value is `true`.

- **log_oname_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  If the value is `true`, add agent names for each log.

## LogSink {#logsink}

In whatap.agent-2.1.0 or later, the LogSink function is provided for integrated monitoring of the application server.

:::caution

The LogSink option is available in whatap.agent-2.1.0 or later.

:::

### Enabling the log monitoring function

- **logsink_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  It enables the log monitoring function.

- **logsink_trace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to expose the log tab of the transaction trace by inserting the transaction ID into the logs.  

### Collecting framework logs

To monitor logs collected from the framework, add the setting and plugin to intercept logs from the module. Set the default category name for logs collected in the framework to `AppLog`. The default value is the same as in the `hooklog_enabled` option.

- **hooklog_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `logsink_enabled`

  Set whether or not to enable the log tracing.

  :::note

  - In Java Agent 2.2.4 or later, the changed options can be applied without restarting the application. 

  - If the `hooklog_enabled` value has been changed, restarting is required for Java agent versions less than 2.2.4. The default value of `hooklog_enabled` is `logsink_enabled`. Accordingly, if `logsink_enabled=true` is set and the Java application is restarted, `hooklog_enabled` is set to `true`.

  :::

- **hooklog_custom_methods** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Register a custom log. An arbitrary log framework content is delivered. Use this to trace logs of the log module created on the website.

  ```java title='Java'
  package io.home.test;

  public class MyLog {  
    public void customLog(String log) { ... }
  }
  ```

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  hooklog_custom_methods=io.home.test.MyLog.customLog
  ```

### Setting to exclude a specific log appender {#excludeappender}

It provides agent options to exclude specific log appenders. The following agent options are provided to exclude specific appenders from monitoring.

- **ignore_logback_appender_set** <span class='type'>String</span> <code className="my">Java Agent v2.2.28 or later</code>

  It is the agent option to exclude specific appenders when tracing logback-1.2.8. For example, to exclude `CONSOLE` and `ACCESS_APPENDER`, see the following example.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  weaving=logback-1.2.8
  # example: ignore 'CONSOLE', 'ACCESS_APPENDER' appender
  ignore_logback_appender_set=CONSOLE,ACCESS_APPENDER
  ```

  :::note

  - If you apply this agent option, you must additionally apply the `weaving=logback-1.2.8` option.

  - `ACCESS_APPENDER` is an example value. Specify an appender name that matches your environment.

  :::

- **ignore_log4j_appender_set** <span class='type'>String</span> <code className="my">Java Agent v2.2.28 or later</code>

  It is the agent option to exclude specific appenders when tracing log4j-2.17. For example, to exclude `CONSOLE` and `ACCESS_APPENDER`, see the following example.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  weaving=log4j-2.17
  # example: ignore 'CONSOLE', 'ACCESS_APPENDER' appender
  ignore_log4j_appender_set=CONSOLE,ACCESS_APPENDER
  ```

  :::note

  - When applying this agent option, you must additionally apply the `weaving=log4j-2.17` option.

  - `ACCESS_APPENDER` is an example value. Specify an appender name that matches your environment.
