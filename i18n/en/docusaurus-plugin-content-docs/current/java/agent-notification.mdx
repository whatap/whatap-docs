description: The following explains how to configure notifications for various events that occur in the application server through Java agents. It includes the options to configure event notifications for transaction recursive calls, denial of service, HTTPC connection errors, excess of heap and disk usage, CPU usage threshold violation, DB connection duplicate allocations, and exceptions. For each event, you can make detailed adjustments such as release interval, release status, and threshold settings.

The following explains how to configure notifications for various events that occur in the application server through Java agents. It includes the options to configure event notifications for transaction recursive calls, denial of service, HTTPC connection errors, excess of heap and disk usage, CPU usage threshold violation, DB connection duplicate allocations, and exceptions. For each event, you can make detailed adjustments such as release interval, release status, and threshold settings.

- **recursive_event_interval** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the interval between event notifications for recursive calls of transactions.

- **reject_event_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to issue an event notification when any service is rejected (call load restriction/decline).

- **reject_event_interval** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the event notification interval when any service is rejected (call load restriction/decline).

- **httpc_event_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to issue event notification when an HTTPC connection error occurs.

- **httpc_event_interval** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the event notification interval when an HTTPC connection error occurs.

- **heap_event_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to issue an event notification when the heap usage threshold is reached.

- **heap_event_percent** <span class='type'>Percentage</span>

  Default `90`

  Set the threshold for issuing heap usage event notifications.

- **heap_event_duration** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `30000`

  Set the duration for issuing heap usage event notifications.

- **heap_event_interval** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the interval for issuing heap usage event notifications.

- **heap_event_action** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `NONE`

  Set the dynamic loading code to run when a heap usage event occurs.

  :::

- **disk_event_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to issue an event notification when the disk usage threshold is reached.

- **disk_event_percent** <span class='type'>Percentage</span>

  Default `90`

  Set the threshold for issuing disk usage event notifications.

- **disk_event_interval** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the interval for issuing disk usage event notifications.

- **disk_event_action** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the dynamic loading code to run when a disk usage event occurs.

- **cpu_event_percent** <span class='type'>Percentage</span>

  Default `90`

  Set the threshold for issuing CPU usage envent notificaiton.

- **cpu_event_duration** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `30000`

  Set the duration for issuing CPU usage event notifications.

- **cpu_event_interval** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the interval for issuing CPU usage event notifications.

- **cpu_event_action** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the ID to passed to the dynamic loading code to run when a CPU usage event occurs.

  :::

- **dbc_dup_event_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to issue an event notification when the DB connection is duplicated.

- **dbc_dup_event_fullstack_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to secure a stack when the allocated DB connection is duplicated.
