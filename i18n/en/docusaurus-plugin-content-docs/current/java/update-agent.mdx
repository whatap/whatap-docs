## Automatic configuration of the update agent

To update the Java agent, the server must be restarted. If _whatap.agent.jar_ is modified before restart, a graceful shutdown may fail while the application server is restarting.

To update the Java agent, proceed in the following order:

1.  App shutdown
2.  Modification of the agent jar
3.  App start

To easily process the above steps, the agent jar file name is to include the version number. It is important to set to automatically apply the latest versions during the update.

```bash {3} showLineNumbers
########## WHATAP ############
WHATAP_HOME=/whatap
WHATAP_JAR=`ls ${WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-*.jar | sort -V | tail -1`
JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -javaagent:${WHATAP_JAR} "
########## WHATAP ############
```
