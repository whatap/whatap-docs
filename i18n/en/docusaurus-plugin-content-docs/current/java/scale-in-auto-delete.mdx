title: Automatic deletion of the agent in Scale In
description: The following explains how to automatically delete the Java agent when an automatically scaled system performs Scale In in the Auto Scale environment. The agent sends a SILENT_SHUTDOWN event to the server by creating a specific file, which automatically removes the agent from the list. This process facilitates agent management when the system automatically scales down, and manages resources efficiently without additional intervention.

If an agent name is automatically assigned in the Auto Scale environment, administrator's intervention is not required when a scale out occurs. The system scales up automatically. If a scale in occurs, the system must recognize it as a graceful shutdown.

For automatic deletion of the agent, the WhaTap server must receive messages from the Java agent. The agent sends a **SILENT_SHUTDOWN** event to the Whatap server when the _whatap_`{java-process-pid}`.shutdown_ file of the Java process appears in `${WHATAP_HOME}`. Transfers are completed within 5 seconds.

When the **SILENT_SHUTDOWN** event has been transferred to the WhaTap server and then the agent is shut down within 1 minute, the WhaTap server deletes the agent from the list. Any inactive event does not occur.

:::note

In case of Tomcat, you can configure in the _shutdown.sh_ file.

```bash title=$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
touch $WHATAP_HOME/whatap_{java-process-pid}.shutdown
```
