The following explains how to fine-tune the agent functionality for monitoring Java application servers. It includes the functions such as enabling/disabling agents, tracing transactions and performance counters, and collecting OS data. You can see various setting options that control each function.

- **shutdown** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  If it is `true`, all actions of the agent are stopped and the connection with the server is finished.

- **enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  All functions are enabled. Even when the value is `false`, the minimum data to maintain communication with the server is sent.

- **transaction_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It enables the transaction tracing. It corresponds to transaction data recorded in the hitmap. If the `enabled` option is `false`, this is disabled.

- **counter_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  The performance counter tracing is enabled. It includes the number of active transactions and users, JVM usage, process CPU usage, and DB pool usage. If the `enabled` option is `false`, this is disabled.

- **stat_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  The statistical data tracing is enabled. The statistical data includes transactions, SQLs, HTTP calls, user agents, and client IPs that are collected every 5 minutes. If the `enabled` option is `false`, this is disabled.

- **sigar_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  The OS data collection through the sigar library is enabled. The OS resource data includes CPU, memory, and disk that are collected every 5 minutes through the sigar library. If the `enabled` option is `false`, this is disabled.

  :::note

  - In earlier than whatap.agent.2.1.0, the default value is `true`. In whatap.agent.2.1.0 or later, the default value is `false`.

  - In Java 1.6 or earlier, you can enable the sigar library and collect performance metrics by adding the `sigar_enabled=true` option.

  :::

- **active_stack_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Active stack tracing is enabled. The tracing data includes Top Stack, Unique Stack, and Active Stack in the Stack menus. If the value of `enabled` or `counter_enabled` is `false`, this is disabled.

- **license** <span class='type'>String</span>

  To install the agent, set the access key granted from the server. The access key includes the agent's project and the encryption key for secured communication.

- **cypher_level** <span class='type'>aes_bit [128, 256]</span>

  Default `128`

  Set the cypher level for the AES security algorithm. It can be expanded up to 256 bits. For more information about the AES 256 encryption configuration, see [the following](aes-256-encryption).

- **encrypt_level** <span class='type'>encrypt_level [1, 2, 3]</span>

  Default `2`

  The WhaTap agent encrypts data selectively depending on the attributes when transferring data to the server. It has performance benefits along with high security. To apply encryption policies in bulk regardless of the data type, see the following options.

  - `1`: Encrypted transmission disabled
  - `2`: Encrypted transmission for sensitive attributes such as SQL parameters and plain texts.
  - `3`: Encrypted transmission for all items

- **stat_ip_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Among the side menus of the project, the <Cmdname sid="side_statistics" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_statRemote" className="uitext" /> menu enables whether to use the IP statistics.

  :::note 

  See [the following](/java/analysis-apm-trs#client_tx_stat).

  :::

- **stat_ipurl_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Among the side menus of the project, the <Cmdname sid="side_statistics" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_statIp" className="uitext" /> menu sets whether or not to collect the statistics data. 

  :::note 

  See [the following](/java/analysis-apm-trs#statiptx).

  :::

- **realtime_user_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Among the side menus of the project, the <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt;<Cmdname sid="dashboard_user" className="uitext" /> menu can set whether to collect the <Cmdname sid="side_appDashboard" className="uitext" /> out of the metrics that can be checked.

- **hook_direct_patch_classes** <span class='type'>ClassFile_FullPath</span>

    It is used to directly replace a specific class at the loading time. After compiling the class, it creates a separate file and sets the full path to that file.

- **active_stack_second** <span class='type'>Seconds</span>

  Default `10`

  Set the interval for tracing the active stacks.

  :::caution

  It is recommended not to change the given default value.

  :::

- **boot_redefine_size** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `100`

  If the agent has been installed in the Attach or Watcher method, BCI is newly performed to trace the already loaded classes. At this time, it sets the number of classes to redefine at the same time.

- **trace_component_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Among the side menus of the project, the <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_libraryVersion" className="uitext" /> menu is enabled.

- **realtime_user_thinktime_max** / **wclient_thinktime_max** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the maximum call interval credited by the same user when measuring the number of real-time browser users.

  :::note

  In case of Java Agent 2.2.0 or later, use the `wclient_thinktime_max` option.

  :::

- **time_sync_interval_ms** <span class='type'>MiliSeconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the synchronization time interval between the agent and the server. For no synchronization, set it to `0`.

- **detect_deadlock_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  It generates an event when any Java thread is deadlocked. The occurrence interval is 5 seconds. Events for the same deadlock occur once per hour.

- **text_reset** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `0`

  The WhaTap agent does not transmit the text data once sent until the next day again because it is hashed. If a value is set different from the previous setting, the data is sent again.

  :::note

  Transaction URLs and SQL strings correspond to text data.
