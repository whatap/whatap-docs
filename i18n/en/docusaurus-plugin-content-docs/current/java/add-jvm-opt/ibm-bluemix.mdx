The following explains how to apply the WhaTap agent when deploying with **IBM BlueMix**. 

[IBM BlueMix](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/apps/index.html%E2%80%8B) provides the **WebSphere Liberty** environment with the container. **Liberty** is a lightweight environment different from **WebSphere Application Server**, and it is similar to how **Spring Boot** works.

{@include: _pass-note.mdx}

The following is an example of the configuration environment. These files are created in the local development environment when configuring the environment according to [Guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs).

```bash
whatap@vmwas01:/apps/bluemix/java-helloworld$ ls -alrt

```

1.  In `${APP_HOME}`, create the _src/main/resources/whatap-agent/_ directory and then copy jar files and conf files.

    ```bash
    $ mkdir -p src/main/resources/whatap-agent/
    $ cp /apps/whatap/whatap.agent.tracer-1.5.4.jar src/main/resources/whatap-agent/
    $ cp /apps/whatap/whatap.conf src/main/resources/whatap-agent/
    ```

2.  Add options in the _${APP_HOME}/manifest.yml_ file. Because it is a yml file, write it with according to spacing and indentation standards.

    ```yaml title=${APP_HOME}/manifest.yml {8-9} showLineNumbers

:::note

-   The _whatap.conf_ configuration is applied the same as in non-PaaS environments. Because it may be difficult to identify the agent name after application, apply the agent name that suits the situation.
-   For more information about the agent naming, see [the following](../agent-name).
