## Adding the boot environment

This guide explains how to add required JVM options to effectively use the Java monitoring agent in the JBoss application server environment.

For JVM options, add options for `-javaagent` and `-Djboss.modules.system.pkgs`.

### JBOSS 7.0 or later & EAP 6.0 or later

Installation location: (JBoss installation path)/bin/standalone.conf(domain.conf)

```bash title=standalone.sh
#!/bin/sh
########## WHATAP ############
WHATAP_HOME=/home/ec2-user/whatap
WHATAP_JAR=`ls ${WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-*.jar | sort -V | tail -1`
JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -javaagent:${WHATAP_JAR} -Djboss.modules.system.pkgs=whatap"
########## WHATAP ############
```

:::note

For JBoss 5.0 or earlier, set in the _(JBoss installation path)/bin/run.conf_ path. If any error occurs, add the `-Djboss.platform.mbeanserver=true` option.

:::

### Java 17 or later

{@include: _java-17.mdx} 

{@include: _set-heap-memory.mdx} 

## Starting the monitoring

{@include: ../../common-items/_start-apm.mdx}
