The following explains how to apply the WhaTap agent in a batch application. 

Different from WAS, the batch application runs and stops repeatedly. Accordingly, it must be monitored differently.

## Download agent

You can download the agent for batch application monitoring through the following link:

## Installing the batch job

The batch job must be monitored from a single transaction perspective. WhaTap's Java agent needs to install two separate agents: Job agent for job processes and Host agent for relaying this information to the server.

```bash title='Batch Job Agent'
java -javaagent:/full/path/to/whatap.agent.batch-X.Y.Z.jar -jar {batch job jar}
```

```bash title='Batch Host Agent'
java -jar whatap.agent.host-X.Y.Z.jar
```

:::note

The batch job agent and batch host agent must be installed in the host that performs the batch job.

{@include: _java-17.mdx}

## Setting the time limit

Between the batch job agent and batch host agent, communication is enabled through UDP.

Generally, a batch job is performed for a long time. It may take more than tens of seconds. Accordingly, the `time_limit` values may differ depending on each batch job. Set the estimated process time for the batch job in `time_limit`.

```ini title=whatap.conf
time_limit=300000
warning_time=time_limit's 70%
step_interval=5000
```

## Setting the active equalizer's color

If the process time of a batch job exceeds 70% of `time_limit`, it is distinguished in yellow. If it exceeds `time_limit`, it is displayed in red.

```ini title='whatap.conf' {2,4} showLineNumbers
## 70% of the estimated end time
yellow_time = time_limit * 0.7;
## upon exceeding the estimated end time
red_time = time_limit;
```

:::note

In order for the server administrator to check the delay of a batch job in real time, set the value of `time_limit` properly.

## Setting the active stack's collection interval

The batch job agent collects active stacks at an interval of `step_interval`.
