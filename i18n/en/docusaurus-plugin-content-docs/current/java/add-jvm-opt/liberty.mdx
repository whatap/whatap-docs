## Adding JVM options

The following explains how to add required JVM options to effectively use the Java monitoring agent in the Liberty application server environment.

In the _jvm.options_ file, add the agent option. If no file, create a new one.

```bash title=/wasliberty/usr/servers/defaultServer/jvm.options {2} showLineNumbers
-javaagent:/app/whatap/whatap.agent-2.1.1.jar
-Dorg.osgi.framework.bootdelegation=whatap.* ## Additional options for OSGI framework configuration ##
```

:::note

{@include: _java-17.mdx}

{@include: _set-heap-memory.mdx} 

## Starting the monitoring
