## Applying the agent

Based on an existing Docker image, build an image with the WhaTap agent settings added.

:::note

The following handles only installation of the Java agent. See the separate procedure when applying with WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring.

:::

1. Create a Docker build directory.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p {Docker build dir}
   ```

2. Create the _whatap.conf_ file.

   ```docker {3,5} showLineNumbers
   cat >{Docker build Dir}/whatap.conf <<EOL
   #Enter the access key.
   license=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
   #Enter the collection server IP.
   whatap.server.host=xx.xx.xx.xx/yy.yy.yy.yy 
   EOL
   ```

3. Create a Dockerfile.

   In case of building an image, you can copy the jar file to apply in the `-javaagent` option from the WhaTap image.

   ```docker
   cat >/home/silver/whatap/docker/Dockerfile <<EOL
   FROM whatap/kube_mon as build
   ## Create an actual image (Add the WhaTap image)
   ## $Image_Name (image name)
   FROM $Image_Name
   RUN mkdir -p /whatap
   COPY --from=build /data/agent/micro/whatap.agent-*.jar /whatap
   COPY ./whatap.conf /whatap/
   #...
   EOL
   ```

4. In `JAVA_OPT`, add the following content.

   ```bash
   WHATAP_HOME=/whatap
   WHATAP_JAR=ls ${WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-*.jar | sort -V | tail -1
   export JAVA_OPTS="-javaagent:${WHATAP_JAR} "
   ```

5. Build the Docker.

   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker build -t $Image_Name
   ```

:::note

You can modify the Java agent file name by using the `Rename` function. Once the Java agent name has been modified, enter a new name in `JAVA_OPTS`.

**Example of how to modify the Java agent name**

```bash
java -cp whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar whatap.agent.setup.Rename -from whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -to whatap.agent.jar
```
