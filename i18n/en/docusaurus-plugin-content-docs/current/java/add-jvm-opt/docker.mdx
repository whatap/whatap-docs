description: The step-by-step instructions on how to apply the WhaTap Java monitoring agent to Java applications in the Docker environment are provided. Users can add more Whatap Java agent settings to the existing Docker image to see the processes for building a new image, creating the whatap.conf file, writing a Dockerfile, and modifying JAVA_OPT. Additional JVM options for Java 17 or later and the method how to configure the heap histogram lookup for various Java versions are also provided.

Docker is a container-based virtualization platform. When you run Java applications in a Docker container, you can adjust the application's performance and resource usage by adding JVM options. This document explains how to modify the Dockerfile to add JVM options.

:::note

The Docker must have been installed and the Docker images must be built for Java applications.

:::

## Applying the agent

Based on an existing Docker image, build an image with the WhaTap agent settings added.

:::note

This document covers only the installation of the Java agent. To apply with WhaTap Kubernetes monitoring, see [the following](../../kubernetes/install-docker-java).

:::

### Creating the Docker build directory

Create a Docker build directory.

```bash
mkdir -p {Docker build dir}
```

### Creating the agent configuration file

Create the *whatap.conf* file.

```docker {3,5} showLineNumbers
cat >{Docker build Dir}/whatap.conf <<EOL
#Enter the access key.
license=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
#Enter the collection server IP.
whatap.server.host=xx.xx.xx.xx/yy.yy.yy.yy 
EOL
```

### Creating the Dockerfile

To build an image, you can copy the jar files from the WhaTap image to the `-javaagent` option.

```docker
cat >/home/silver/whatap/docker/Dockerfile <<EOL
FROM whatap/kube_mon as build
## Create an actual image (Add the WhaTap image)
## $Image_Name (image name)
FROM $Image_Name
RUN mkdir -p /whatap
COPY --from=build /data/agent/micro/whatap.agent-*.jar /whatap
COPY ./whatap.conf /whatap/
#...
EOL
```

### Applying `JAVA_OPTS`

Add the following to `JAVA_OPT`:

```bash
WHATAP_HOME=/whatap
WHATAP_JAR=ls ${WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-*.jar | sort -V | tail -1
export JAVA_OPTS="-javaagent:${WHATAP_JAR} "
```

### Building the Docker

Build the Docker.

```bash
cd docker
docker build -t $Image_Name
```

:::note

import Java17 from "./_java-17.mdx";

<Java17 />

:::

:::note

You can modify the Java agent file name by using the `Rename` function. Once the Java agent name has been modified, enter a new name in `JAVA_OPTS`.

**Example of how to modify the Java agent name**

```bash
java -cp whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar whatap.agent.setup.Rename -from whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -to whatap.agent.jar
```
