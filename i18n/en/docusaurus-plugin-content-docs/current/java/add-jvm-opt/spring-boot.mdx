description: The following provides the detailed guide on how to add Java Virtual Machine (JVM) options to integrate the WhaTap monitoring solution into Spring Boot applications. Through this document, users can learn step by step how to apply the required JVM settings to monitor the performance and availability of Spring Boot applications after installing the Java agent. It includes the configuration of essential JVM options during agent installation, optimal configuration for smooth integration with Spring Boot, and histogram query.

Check the method how to add JVM options in the application server environment using Spring Boot.

## Adding JVM options

- In case of Java 17 or later, the application can be started by adding JVM options related to the reflection.

  ```bash
  # Only support Java 17 or later
  java -javaagent:{WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -Dwhatap.oname={Agent_Name} --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED -jar {application.jar}
  ```

- For the JVM options in the startup script, add `-javaagent`.

  ```bash
  java -javaagent:{WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -jar {application.jar}
  ```

Add the JVM options and then proceed with the appropriate agent configuration according to the versions of Spring Boot and agents.
