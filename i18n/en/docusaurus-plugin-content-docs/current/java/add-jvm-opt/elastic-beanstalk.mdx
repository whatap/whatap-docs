The following explains how to apply the WhaTap agent when deploying with **Elastic Beanstalk**. 

{@include: _pass-note.mdx}

1.  To release the Spring Boot result as jar, the content of _.ebextensions_ cannot be applied. Compress the following files and deploy the zip file.

    -   _.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml_: Automatically created under the directory where the eb command is executed
    -   _.ebextensions/{config_name}.config_: eb configuration file
    -   _Procfile_: File to configure the JVM command line options
    -   _{application}.jar_: applicaion.jar file to execute

2.  Compress the WhaTap agent file to be applied to the service and then upload it to S3 (or a public downloadable path).

    -   _paramkey.txt_
    -   _whatap.agent-2.0_25.jar_
    -   _whatap.conf_

    ```bash
    # Compressing a directory
    zip -r whatap-agent.zip agent
    ```

3.  Enter the WhaTap agent path in the _.ebextension/{config_name}.config_ file.
     When its zip file to download exists, execute the eb command to download the file and then unzip it.

    ```yaml title=ebextension/{config_name}.config
    sources:
      target directory:
        S3 path
    ```

    ```yaml title='Example'
    sources:
      /home/webapp:
        http://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/{bucket-name}/whatap-agent.zip
    ```

4.  Enter the JVM command with the WhaTap agent option added to create a _Procfile_.

    ```yaml title='Procfile'
    web: java -javaagent:${WHATAP_JAR_FILE_PATH} -Dwhatap.name=${WHATAP_NAME} -Dwhatap.okind=${WHATAP_OKIND_NAME} -Dwhatap.server.home=${APPLICAION_PATH} -Dwhatap.conf.path=${WHATAP_HOME} -jar ${APPLICAIONT}.jar
    ```

    ```yaml title='Example'
    web: java -javaagent:/home/webapp/agent/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -Dwhatap.name=bootTest -Dwhatap.okind=test -Dwhatap.server.home=/var/app/current -Dwhatap.conf.path=/home/webapp/agent -jar whatap-boot-test.jar
    ```

5.  Compress the following files: _Procfile_, _.ebextensions_, and _{application}.jar_.

    ```bash
    zip -r {application}.zip Procfile .ebextensions/{application}.jar
    ```

6.  Add the zip file path to deploy in the _.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml_ file.

    ```yaml
    deploy:
      artifact: /path/to/{application}.zip
    ```

7.  Execure the eb deployment command.

    ```bash
    eb deploy
    ```
