## Applying the agent

The following explains how to apply the WhaTap agent when deploying with **Elastic Beanstalk**. 

import Passnote from "./_pass-note.mdx";

<Passnote />

1. To release the Spring Boot result as jar, the content of _.ebextensions_ cannot be applied. Compress the following files and deploy the zip file.

   - _.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml_: Automatically created under the directory where the eb command is executed
   - _.ebextensions/`{config_name}`.config_: eb configuration file
   - _Procfile_: File to configure the JVM command line options
   - _`{application}`.jar_: applicaion.jar file to execute

2. Compress the WhaTap agent file to be applied to the service and then upload it to S3 (or a public downloadable path).

   - _paramkey.txt_
   - _whatap.agent-2.0_25.jar_
   - _whatap.conf_

   ```bash
   # Compressing a directory
   zip -r whatap-agent.zip agent
   ```

3. Enter the WhaTap agent path in the _.ebextension/`{config_name}`.config_ file.

   When its zip file to download exists, execute the eb command to download the file and then unzip it.

   ```yaml title=ebextension/{config_name}.config
   sources:
     target directory:
       S3 path
   ```

   ```yaml title='Example'
   sources:
     /home/webapp:
       http://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/{bucket-name}/whatap-agent.zip
   ```

4. Enter the JVM command with the WhaTap agent option added to create a _Procfile_.

   ```yaml title='Procfile'
   web: java -javaagent:${WHATAP_JAR_FILE_PATH} -Dwhatap.name=${WHATAP_NAME} -Dwhatap.okind=${WHATAP_OKIND_NAME} -Dwhatap.server.home=${APPLICAION_PATH} -Dwhatap.conf.path=${WHATAP_HOME} -jar ${APPLICAIONT}.jar
   ```

   ```yaml title='Example'
   web: java -javaagent:/home/webapp/agent/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -Dwhatap.name=bootTest -Dwhatap.okind=test -Dwhatap.server.home=/var/app/current -Dwhatap.conf.path=/home/webapp/agent -jar whatap-boot-test.jar
   ```

5. Compress the following files: _Procfile_, _.ebextensions_, and _`{application}`.jar_.

   ```bash
   zip -r {application}.zip Procfile .ebextensions/{application}.jar
   ```

6. Add the zip file path to deploy in the _.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml_ file.

   ```yaml
   deploy:
     artifact: /path/to/{application}.zip
   ```

7. Execure the eb deployment command.

   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```
