## Adding JVM options

This explains how to add required JVM options to effectively use the Java monitoring agent in the Play2 application server environment.

Set the agent options in the _$PLAY_HOME/framework/build_ file. If you have a separate startup or stop script, apply it to that file.

```bash title=$PLAY_HOME/framework/build {6} showLineNumbers
#! /usr/bin/env sh

########## WHATAP START ############
WHATAP_HOME=/apps/whatap
WHATAP_JAR=`ls ${WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-*.jar | sort -V | tail -1`
JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -Dwhatap.play2=2.2.6 -javaagent:${WHATAP_JAR}"
########## WHATAP END ############

if [ -z "${PLAY_VERSION}" ]; then
  PLAY_VERSION="2.2.6"
...
```

:::note

For Play, add the `-Dwhatap.play2=2.2.6` option other than the default settings.
