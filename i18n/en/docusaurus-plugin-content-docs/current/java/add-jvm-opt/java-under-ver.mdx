You can apply the WhaTap agent on the versions earlier than Java 1.6. However, some functions are limited.

## Java 1.5

Java 1.5 supports the `-javaagent` option. However, there are restrictions on information inquiry for external threads, so some functions are limited.

The following functions do not work.

- Real-time trace on active transactions

- Stack analysis (Top stack, Unique stack, Active stack)

- Detailed stack of the thread list

## Java 1.4

Java 1.4 does not have the `-javaagent` option. Install the WhaTap agent differently. Of course, Java 1.4 must be used for the *whatap.agent.jar* file.

> whatap.java14.tracer-`X.Y.Z`.jar

### Creating boot.jar

Create _boot.jar_ by using the _setup.sh_ file. If [JAVA_HOME] is not entered, it automatically recognizes the current path as the location of JDK.

```bash
$ setup.sh [JAVA_HOME]
```

_setup.sh_ execution result: _whatap.java14.boot-`X.Y.Z`.jar_

### Installing in bootclasspath

Using the `bootclasspath` option, add the built jar and tracer jar as prepend.

```java tite='java 실행 옵션'
-Xbootclasspath/p:${WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.java14.boot-1.0.2.jar:${WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.java14.tracer-1.0.2.jar
```

### Constraints

In JDK 1.4, the following functions do not work.

- Real-time trace on active transactions

- Stack analysis (Top stack, Unique stack, Active stack)

- Component version

- Thread list, heap history

- Loaded class

- Open socket

- Agent dump
