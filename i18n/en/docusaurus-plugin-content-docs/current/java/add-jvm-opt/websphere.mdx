## Adding JVM options

This guide explains how to add required JVM options to effectively use the Java monitoring agent in the WebSphere application server environment. To add JVM options, access the Admin console.

1. Log in the Admin Console in your web browser.

2. Select **_Environment_** > **_Virtual Hosts_** > **_default host_** > **_Host Aliases_** and then check the port number of the server to install the agent to.

3. Go to **_Servers_** > **_Server Types_** > **_Websphere application servers_** and then select a server to install the agent to.

4. Select the **_Configuration_** tab on the selected server screen and then select **_Java and Process Management_** > **_Process definition_** in the **_Server Infrastructure_** section.

5. Among the menus on the right, select **_Additional Properties_** > **_Java Virtual Machine_**.

6. In the **_Configuration_** tab, add `-javaagent` and `-Dwhatap.port` to the **_Generic JVM arguments_** field.

   ```bash
   -javaagent:/whatap/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar 
   -Dwhatap.port={port number} ## Port number of the item 2 ##
   ```

## In case the client IP address is not collected

If the client IP addresses are not collected from the dashboard or other menus, see the following. 

To collect valid client IP addresses from the Java agent, it is required to pass the original client IP address from the IBM HTTP server to the backend WebSphere application server. To pass the original client IP address, add `X-Forwarded-For` to the HTTP header on the IBM HTTP server. 

This is handled in more detail in the IBM Support document: [Passing the real client IP from IBM HTTP Server 9.0 to WebSphere Application Server](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/passing-real-client-ip-ibm-http-server-90-websphere-application-server).
