### ![](/img/number-05.png) Viewing the dashboard{#dashboard}

When data is transferred to the WhaTap server after agent installation, you can view the overall project status in real time through **_Dashboard_**. WhaTap Monitoring can show all collected data on the integrated dashboard, which can be freely personalized by user.

-   The displayed performance metrics of applications are collected from the widgets of **_Application Dashboard_**, **_Transaction Map_**, **_Active Transaction_**, **_Application Topology_**, and **_Flex Board_**.

    {@video: https://whatap-landing-resource.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/app-activeTransection.mp4}

-   The server performance metrics collected from each widget of **_Resource Board_**, **_Compound Eye_**, and **_Flex Board_** can be viewed.

    {@video: https://whatap-landing-resource.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/server-compound.mp4}

-   The database performance metrics collected from each widget of **_Instance List_**, **_Instance Monitoring_**, **_Multiple Instance Monitoring_**, **_Slow Query_**, and **_Flex Board_** can be viewed.

    {@video: https://whatap-landing-resource.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/db-realtimeMonitoring.mp4}

-   For Kubernetes, the nodes, containers, applications, logs, and events are dynamically displayed through the widgets of **_Container Map_**.

### ![](/img/number-06.png) External data collection{#collect}

<!-- 텔레그라프, 포커스 -->

You can expand the WhaTap service collection data by using Telegraf and Focus. For more information, see the [Telegraf](telegraf/introduction.mdx) and [Focus](focus/introduction.mdx).

-   You can install a WhaTap plugin to forward the data collected by Telegraf to the WhaTap collection server.
-   By installing the WhaTap Focus, you can upload the values collected by running your own check scripts or database queries to your WhaTap project.

* * *

### ![](/img/ic-number-07.svg) Alert Settings{#notification}

WhaTap Monitoring allows you to set threshold-based alerts for all metrics collected. In **_Alert_**, you can check events, notification settings, and previous records. The alert reception can be set for each individual and it provides various alert reception channels such as Email, SMS, Messenger, etc.

### ![](/img/ic-number-08.svg) Viewing reports{#report}

Reports are the documents that report the service usage and failure records. For example, the monitoring data analysis becomes a metric to determine the direction of service improvement. WhaTap supports task automation by allowing you to create reports through the **_Report_** menu. It provides unit reports for each project and the integrated reports for multiple projects.

:::note

For more information about reporting, see [the following](java/report-intro). For product-specific report guides, see product-specific technical documents.

### ![](/img/ic-number-09.svg) Member Management{#member}

You can add project members in **_Management_** > **_Project Member_**. You can set the permissions for each project and member group, and delete members.
