If you save a SQL script in the agent installation path, you can load the script from the WhaTab Monitoring Service screen and view the execution results of a single or multiple scripts in real time.

- You can load and execute SQL scripts directly within the monitoring tool. This allows you to query data quickly and efficiently without any additional settings or external tools.

- You can save specific SQL scripts in advance and use them repeatedly, which is useful while continuously monitoring or analyzing data. This helps build automated processes by reducing manual tasks.

## Before starting

To run SQL scripts in the <Cmdname sid="side_dbScriptManager" className="uitext" /> menu, keep the following steps to save the SQL scripts to the agent installation path.

1. Go to the *scripts* folder under the agent installation path.

2. Enter into the database type folder. If there is no desired folder, create it.

   :::note 

   The database types supported by WhaTap Script Manager are as follows: 

   > `oracle`, `mysql`, `tibero`, `cubrid`, `mssql`, `postgresql`, `altibase`, `db2`, `sap_ase`

   :::

3. Write an SQL script. At this time, the account that runs the SQL scripts is the one used by the agent.

:::note

The account that executes the SQL script has been specified in the *whatap.conf* file or used in the *uid.sh* file.

:::

## Running an SQL script

1. Go to a database monitoring product project from the WhaTap Monitoring Service's Home screen. 

2. In the <Cmdname sid="TTL08478" className="uitext" /> section of <Cmdname sid="side_lab" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_dbScriptManager" className="uitext" />, select an agent on which the SQL script is to be run.

3. Select a script to run in <Cmdname sid="TTL08480" className="uitext" /> on the left of the screen.

4. In the <Cmdname sid="TTL08478" className="uitext" /> section, check the SQL statement of the selected script, and then click <Cmdname sid="run" className="uitext" />.

5. In the <Cmdname sid="TTL08479" className="uitext" /> section, check the result of the query.

:::note

Because SQL scripts are loaded for each agent installation path, each agent can load different script files.

:::

## Creating the multi-script

:::note

DMX Agent 1.0.4s or later is supported only on **Oracle Pro** products.

:::

When adding `.sql` statements in the `scripts/oracle` path, a query must end with a semicolon (`;`), and queries are separated by line breaks.

## Running Multiple SQL Scripts

1. Select multiple instances to run the script in ***Query Execution Instance*** and then click ***Run***. 

2. All scripts for the selected instance are listed in the ***Script List*** area on the left of the screen.

3. The SQL query statement is displayed in the ***Script SQL*** area. 

   - Multi-scripts are denoted as Query 1, Query 2…, Query n, and the values ​​are the same as those shown in the script results.

   - You can format all at once by activating the ***Formatting*** button at the upper right of the screen.

4. In ***Script Results***, for multi-scripts, tables are displayed as many times of instances and \* queries.
