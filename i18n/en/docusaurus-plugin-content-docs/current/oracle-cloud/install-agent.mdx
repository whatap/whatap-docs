WhaTap Oracle Cloud Monitor collects metrics periodically through API integration. It collects the target stats every 5 minutes from the Oracle Cloud Monitor namespace of the desired service. When you start monitoring, you can search for user resources in all regions and start monitoring with one click. You can use it safely and conveniently by automatically generating the ssh public key required for authentication. 

{@include: ../getting-started/_create-project-cloud.mdx} 

## Monitoring procedure

1.  Enter your Oracle Cloud authentication data.
2.  Select values for the Oracle Cloud Monitor namespace and collection cycle.
3.  Select values for region, metric, and stat.

:::note

After installation, extra charge may be incurred in the cloud depending on the usage, separate from the WhaTap fee. Before installation, check the pricing policy of the active cloud service in [the following](https://www.oracle.com/kr/cloud/price-list/).
