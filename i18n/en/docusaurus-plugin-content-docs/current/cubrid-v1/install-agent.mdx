3. Enter the unzipped folder and then check the *whatap.conf* file. In *whatap.conf*, enter the project access key, WhaTap server data, and DB connection data.

   ```ini title='whatap.conf'
   license=project access key
   whatap.server.host=13.124.11.223/13.209.172.35 // WhaTap Server info

   db = {$CUBRID_HOME/databases/databases.txt's db-name}
   db_ip = {DB server IP address}
   db_port = {$CUBRID_HOME/conf/cubrid_broker.conf's BROKER_PORT (default : 33000)}
   cms_port = {$CUBRID_HOME/conf/cm.conf Ïùò cm_port (default : 8001)}
   cms_token_file = {agent installation path}/cms_token
   broker = query_editor,broker1
   ```

   :::note

   - For more information about `cms_token_file` and `broker` options, see [the following](agent-dbx-settings#cubrid).

   - The name to set with the `broker` option can be viewed by the `cubrid broker status` command.

4. Download the JDBC driver to the following directory. */unzipped folder/jdbc*

   Download the JDBC driver for the OS and version of your database server. https://www.cubrid.com/downloads

import Dbinstallagentcommonnotes from "../common-items/_db-install-agent-common-notes.mdx";

## Creating the monitoring account

Both a DB account and a CUBRID Manager account are required for CUBRID monitoring. In general, the default dba account (`dba`) of the database and the CUBRID Manager account (`admin`) are used. You can also create a separate account.

## Creating the DB user file{#create-db-user}

Generate an encrypted UID for database connection. All user files must be run for both the user DB (`dba`) and CUBRID Manager (`admin`). Enter the username and password and then run the shell script (or batch file). 

- *The uid.sh* shell script file (or *uid.bat* batch file) can be found in the path where the WhaTap database agent has been installed.

- `dba` and `DB_PASSWORD` are the username and password used for sign up.

  ```bash title='uid.sh | uid.bat'
  ./uid.sh dba DB_PASSWORD
  ./cmsuid.sh admin ADMIN_PASSWORD

  # Or

  ./uid.bat "dba" "DB_PASSWORD"
  ./cmsuid.bat "admin" "ADMIN_PASSWORD"
  ```

:::note

- After setting it once, it collects data from the database server to be monitored through the encrypted UID.
- To create a DB user file, enter the project access key in the whatap.conf file. [Verify project access key](#check-accesskey)
- In the Azure database environment, enter `DB_USER` in the form of DB_USER@DB_name.
- If special characters are included in `dba` or `DB_PASSWORD`, enter the escape character (\\) together before any special characters.

  ```bash title='Example'
  ./uid.sh whatap whatap\!pwd

  # If there are multiple special characters, add the escape character(\) for each.
  ./uid.sh whatap whatap\!\@pwd
  ```
