The WhaTap database monitoring service (DBX) provides the performance monitoring service by collecting data based on queries. The database performance management monitors the database performance in real time and diagnoses and analyzes the problems. Tune and adapt any problematic SQLs to see whether the issue has been resolved.

## CUBRID Monitoring features

- **Realtime DB Monitoring**

  It collects DB performance metrics and running SQLs in real time to share data required for problem analysis and performance optimization, enabling data-based decision making. It provides a dashboard for major issues of concern, such as active sessions and lock trees, and detects alert occurrences in real time. Provide clues for SQL tuning by checking the plan of a specific SQL.

- **Specific point analysis**

  By using the metrics' short-term trends, long-term trends, and metric comparison functions, you can analyze problems at the past. You can check historical data such as SQL, Lock Tree, Parallel Query, and tablespace increase/decrease.  It traces changes in database parameters.

- **Efficient structure even on a large scale**

  Even when managing multiple DB servers, it provides an optimal analysis environment through unified performance data collection and efficient data storage structure.

- **Integrated Monitoring**

  If you have installed all applications, servers, and database monitoring products, you can quickly analyze the causes of failures through linked views when detecting service problems.

- **WhaTap SaaS**

  You can select from various database products, and freely set the period of use by monthly subscription. (available also with an installation type)
