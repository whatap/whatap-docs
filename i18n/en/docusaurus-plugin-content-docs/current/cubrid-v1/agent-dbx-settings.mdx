Write the settings for the DBX agent in the *whatap.conf* file. For the options that can be set, see the following.

## Default options

import Dbagentdbxbasicoption from "../common-items/_db-agent-dbx-basic-option.mdx";

<Dbagentdbxbasicoption />

## CUBRID-dedicated options{#cubrid}

- **db_port** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `0`

  Broker port information used for application connection information. Enter the value defined in `BROKER_PORT` in the broker configuration file (*cubrid_broker.conf*). (CUBRID's default value `BROKER_PORT: 33000`)

- **cms_port** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `8001`

  Port used by **CUBRID Manager**. Enter the value defined in the `cm_port` field in the **CUBRID Manager** configuration file (*cm.conf*). It is required to obtain monitoring information through the **CUBRID Manager** API.

- **cms_token_file** <span class='type'>String</span>

  If there are multiple user-created DBs, the WhaTap agent must be installed and set up for each database. In this case, the `cms_token_file` path is required to share tokens between agents. Set it to *`{Agent installation path}`/cms_token*. 

  For example) If agent2 has been installed, set as follows to share the `cms_token_file` path of agent1.

  ```ini title='whtap.conf'

  cms_token_file=/agent1/cms_token

  ```

- **broker** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `broker1`, `query_editor`

  Once CUBRID has been installed, the broker runs as `broker1` and `query_editor` by default. If you arbitrarily changed the name of the broker or started it additionally, enter the changes.

  :::note

  The name to set with the `broker` option can be viewed by the `cubrid broker status` command.
