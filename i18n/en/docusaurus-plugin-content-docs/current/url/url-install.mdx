For **access testing to a closed network site**, you may need to open the firewall to allow calls from the agent. The location IP address is displayed as a help. The **Firewall open target IP addresses** of each agent are as follows.

If **cloudflare** is used, you must allow the **region IPs that are compatible with its firewall rules**.
