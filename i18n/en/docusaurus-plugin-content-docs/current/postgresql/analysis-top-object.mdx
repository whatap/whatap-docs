It provides objects with the bloating size, scan count, DML execution count, and objects with many dead tuples for each object (table, index) of individual instance, and provides information to identify objects that are used a lot and perform Vacuum or Analyze at appropriate times.

<ImgLang img='db-top-object.png' desc='Top object' />

-   Set <Cmdname sid="date" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06346" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="TTL06345" className="uitext" /> to view on the screen and then select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png). The results for the selected conditions appear in the table.

-   If you select the **_tablename_** or **_indexname_** column in the inquiry list, the **_Object detail_** window appears where you can see the configuration for **column** and **index**.

    ![Object detail](/img/release/release-db-object-details-topobject.png)

    :::note

    **_Object detail_** is provided in the DBX agent 1.6.15 or later. For more information about the database roles and related settings, see [the following](install-agent#uid).

    :::

:::note

-   The <Cmdname sid="dbObjectInfo" /> data is collected once a day. For more information about the related agent settings, see <Link to="#set-agent-topObject">the following</Link>.

-   To view data, the DB monitoring account requires the following roles:

    ```sql
    grant select on all tables in schema {schema_name} to whatap;
    ```

-   This function is supported in DBX agent 1.6.13 or later.

:::

## Bloating

**Bloating** is a phenomenon in which the object size increases due to an increase of unused tuples. 

Tables and indexes with the values greater than the collection reference set in `table[index]_bloat_ratio[bytes]` in the agent configuration (_whatap.conf_), appear in the list. If there is no corresponding object, data may not be viewed.

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

For tables with higher `Bloat_ratio`, consider performing the Vacuum operation. For more information, see the following document.

If <span class="uitext">Bloating</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.

## Scan

`Seq_scan` means the full scan without using indexes, and `idx_scan` means the number of index uses.

:::tip

**Tuning tips** 

Consider creating indexes for tables with higher `Seq_scan` and deleting indexes with lower `idx_scan`. For more information, see [the following](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/performance-tips.html).

:::

If <span class="uitext">Scan</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.

|     ^     | `idx_tup_read`  | Number of index items returned by index scan                        |

## DML

Tables with higher `dml_count` values are frequently used tables.

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

Identify the main tables in your system and then use them as references when changing tables or designing the architecture.

:::

If <span class="uitext">DML</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.

| Column name     | Description                                                          |

## Analyze Time

This list includes objects for which Analyze and Vacuum operations have become outdated.

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

Older tables may have inaccurate statistical information. Review the operations. For more information, see [the following](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-vacuum-and-analyze-best-practice-tips).

:::

If <span class="uitext">Analyze Time</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.

| Column name           | Description                                                       |

| `last_analyze`        | Last time of manual table analysis                                |
| `last_autoanalyze`    | Last time of table analysis by the autovacuum daemon              |
| `last_autovacuum`     | Last time of table cleanup (vacuum) by the autovacuum daemon      |
| `analyze_count`       | Number of manual analyses                                         |
| `last_vacuum`         | Last time of table vacuumed manually (VACUUM FULL not applicable) |
| `autoanalyze_count`   | Number of analyses by the autovacuum daemon                       |
| `autovacuum_count`    | Number of cleanups (vacuum) by the autovacuum daemon              |
| `vacuum_count`        | Number of manual cleanups (vacuum) (VACUUM FULL excluded)         |
| `n_mod_since_analyze` | Number of lines changed since last analysis (analyze)             |

## Age

In PostgreSQL, XID (transaction id) is used recursively so that the XID may wrap around at a certain point. To prevent this, `xid_age` (Current XID - XID at the time of creation) must be managed so that it does not keep increasing. If `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` exceeds, Anti-Wraparound Vacuum is automatically performed and `xid_age` is managed below `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`.

This list displays vacuum targets that meet the following criteria: If there is no target, data may not be viewed.

-   Table with dead tuples more than vacuum threshold (`autovacuum_threshold` + `autovacuum_scale_factor` \* `number-of-tuples`).

-   Table with the age (`relfrozenxid`) greater than `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

If `xid_age` continues to increase, XID cleaning may not be performed under the set Auto Vaccum condition. Adjust the auto vacuum parameters or review the vacuum execution manually.

For more information, see [the following](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND).

:::

If <span class="uitext">Age</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.

| Column name                 | Description                                                               |

| `autovacuum_vacuum_tuples`  | If the number of dead tuples exceeds this value, autovacuum is performed. |
| `dead_tuples`               | Number of dead tuples                                                     |
| `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` | The default value is set to 200 million.                                  |

## Dead Tuple

Dead tuple is the data that has already been deleted using Delete or Update. Review the Vacuum operation to change to free space.

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

To reduce dead tuples, review the Vacuum operation. For more information, see [the following](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html).

:::

If <span class="uitext">Dead Tube</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.
