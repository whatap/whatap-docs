In **_Session History_**, you can see what has been performed in a specific session during the query period. It provides information that allows you to check how much resource has been used for SQL for a long-running session and analyze the causes.

## Basic usage guide

You must enter the session number (**_Process ID_**) to monitor as a required value, but it is more efficient to enter through the **_Instance monitoring_** menu.

1.  Go to **_Dashboard_** > **_Instance monitoring_**.

2.  Select a session that is running and not ended for a long time.

3.  If the **_Session detail_** window appears, select **_Session History_**.

    <ImgLang img='db-session-history-02.png' desc='Session History' />

The **_Session History_** menu appears that has searched the process ID (PID) of the selected session.

Active session data collected every 5 seconds from the selected session is used to construct a chart and its list and provide information that can be used for analysis. 

-   **_Wait_**: You can see the percentage of waiting events through a chart.

-   **_Cpu_**: You can see the change trend in CPU usage through the chart.

-   **_Memory_**: You can see the change trend in memory usage through the chart.

-   **_Disk I/O_**: You can see the change trend in disk usage through the chart.

-   If you select the **_query_** column on the utmost right of the list, the **_SQL details_** window appears where you can see the SQL statement. It contains full texts and plan information for the selected query.
