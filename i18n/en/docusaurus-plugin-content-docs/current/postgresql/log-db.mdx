WhaTap provides the database log monitoring service. You can collect logs from server-installed databases and AWS RDS that is a cloud service. Through this, you can check the scattered logs in the database at a glance in **_Live Tail_** and **_Log Trend_** for log monitoring.

:::tip

After log monitoring has been applied, installed DB is displayed as `#DB`, AWS RDS as `#RDS_LOG`, and `#RDS_EVENT` in **_Category_** of each menu and the log list.

## Server-installed DB

To monitor logs in server-installed databases, apply the following options in _xos.conf_ file.

<InDoc product='mysql'>

```ini title='xos.conf'
file=/var/log/mysqld.log
file1=/var/log/mysql_history.log
file2=/var/lib/mysql/dbx-database-slow.log
```

</InDoc>

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

```ini title='xos.conf'
file=/opt/postgresql/logs/postgresql.log
file1=/opt/postgresql/data/logs/pg10/postgresql-Sun.log
file2=/opt/postgresql/data/logs/pg10/postgresql-Mon.log
file3=/opt/postgresql/data/logs/pg10/postgresql-Tue.log
```

</InDoc>

:::note

Before application, install the XOS agent and then proceed with agent configuration. For more information, see [the following](agent-xos-settings).

## AWS RDS Log

AWS provides various information for RDS monitoring. To check information, directly access the AWS console. However, WhaTap's **AWS RDS Log** provides logs and events from RDS in **_Log_** under Database Monitoring.

![AWS RDS Log](/img/aws-rds-log-diagram.png)

**AWS RDS Log** can be installed through [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ko_kr/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html).

### Checking the roles

To install **AWS RDS Log** through **AWS CloudFormation**, check the required IAM role.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudformation:CreateStack",
        "cloudformation:UpdateStack",
        "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
        "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
        "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents",
        "cloudformation:DescribeStackResource"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:CreateBucket",
        "s3:PutBucketVersioning",
        "s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "lambda:CreateFunction",
        "lambda:UpdateFunctionCode",
        "lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
        "lambda:DeleteFunction",
        "lambda:AddPermission"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:GetRole",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Checking the created resourced

Check the resources installed through **AWS CloudFormation**.

![AWS RDS Log](/img/aws-rds-log-resource.png)

-   **S3** 

    -   Bucket: AWS S3 bucket (CopyZips) that stores executable files of WhaTab **AWS RDS Log**

-   **Lambda**

    -   Function 

        -   CopyZipsFunction: AWS Lambda function that moves executable files from the WhaTap AWS S3 bucket to your environment

        -   WhaTapRDSLog: AWS Lambda function for AWS RDS monitoring

    -   Permission

        -   CWPermission: Permission to run WhataTapRDSLog when logs are created in RDS CloudWatchLogGroup

        -   EventBridgePermission: Permission to run WhataTapRDSLog in EventBridge when RDS events occur

    -   Role

        -   Role required for CopyZipsFunction to get files from WhaTap's S3 and put them into CopyZips

        -   Role required for WhatTapRDSLog to leave logs in CloudWatchLogGroup

### Installation

Access the [AWS CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-northeast-2#/stacks/quickcreate?stackName=WhaTapRDS&templateURL=https://whatapforwarder.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/WhaTapRDSLogInstall.template) screen. In the **Parameters** section, enter the following:

-   **Host**: Address of the WhaTap collection server. It can be viewed in **_Management_** > **_Agent installation_** under the WhaTap project. e.g. 13.124.11.223 / 13.209.172.35

-   **MemorySize**: WhaTapRDSLog's memory size. Enter a value between 128 MB and 10,240 MB.

-   **Pcode**: Project code of a WhaTap project. Check the **_project code_** in **_Management_** > **_Project management_**.

-   **ProjectAccessKey**: Access key of a WhaTap project. Check the **_project access key_** in **_Management_** > **_Project management_**.

-   **TimeOut**: Maximum time in which the installed WhatTapRDSLog is maintained while running.

-   **UseReservedConcurrency**: Whether or not to use the reserved concurrency for WhatTapRDS.

-   **ReservedConcurrency**: Maximum number of instances that WhatapRDS can run at the same time when using the reserved concurrency.

#### Output

![AWS CloudFormation output](/img/aws-rds-log-setting-output.png)

### Checking the filters and rules

![AWS CloudFormation](/img/aws-rds-log-check-resources.png)

-   **WS CloudWatchLogGroup**

    SubscriptionFilter (1-9): Filter that executes WhatapRDSLog when logs come into the CloudWatch LogGroup of RDS.

-   **AWS EventBridge**

    Rule: Rule that triggers WhatapRDSLog when RDS events occur among AWS events

### Configuration

Access the [AWS CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-northeast-2#/stacks/quickcreate?stackName=whataprdseventforwarder&templateURL=https://whatapforwarder.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/WhaTapRDSLogSetting.template) screen. In the **Parameters** section, enter the following:

![AWS CloudFormation](/img/aws-rds-log-set-parameter.png)

-   **AwsRdsNames**: List of names of RDS clusters and instances to receive events

    -   e.g. database-1, seoul-pro-db-01, seoul-pro-db-01-writer …

    -   Enter `none` if you do not want to create an event rule.

-   **RdsLogGroupName (1-9)**: RDS CloudWatchLogGroup name from which you want to receive logs

    -   e.g. /aws/rds/seoul-pro-db-01

    -   Enter `none` if you do not want to create a subscription filter.

-   **WhaTapRDSLogArn**: WhataTapRDSLogArn generated in the previous step (in the output)

:::note

You can connect up to 9 CloudWatch log groups.
