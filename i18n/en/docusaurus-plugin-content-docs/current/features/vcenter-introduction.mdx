**Feature Project**<ScrollToLink anchor='feature-project' />

WhaTap newly introduced **Feature Project** (<code class='Features'>Features</code>) so that users can easily check whether the desired software supports monitoring and easily start monitoring. The Feature Project provides an optimized monitoring solution by repackaging existing monitoring products to fit the software to monitor. Manage your services for stability and performance more effectively through the WhaTap's Feature Project. 

:::

***vCenter*** is VMware's unified management platform optimized for centrally managing and monitoring data center resources in the virtualized environment. Simplify IT infrastructure operations and increase management efficiency by efficiently managing multiple virtual machines (VMs), hosts, storage, and networks through a single interface.

WhaTap provides the ***vCenter*** monitoring in a new **feature project** manner. WhaTap lets you trace the performance and status of the vCenter infrastructure in real time, to detect and resolve issues early as possible.

- **Metrics Monitoring**: It monitors various system metrics in real time, such as CPU, memory, and storage usage of each virtual machine and the host.

- **Custom Dashboard**: You can view the metrics efficiently through this dashboard.

- **Alert Settings**: Alerts are sent in real time when the set conditions are detected, allowing users to quickly respond to the problems.

Manage complex virtualization environments effectively with the WhaTap ***vCenter*** monitoring.

## Installation

This guide provides the basic installation instructions for using the WhaTap vCenter monitoring service. 

To use the WhaTap monitoring service, after [Sign up](https://www.whatap.io/en/signup/), create a project and then install the agent to the target server. For more information about membership registration, see [the following](../account/account-manage).

The WhaTap ***vCenter*** monitoring provides various metrics to help you manage the overall operation status by monitoring the performance and status of the vCenter environment in real time. It regularly monitors key metrics to make sure the infrastructure operates securely and performs optimally.

The **vCenter Dashboard** provided by WhaTap consists of the following five presets:

- ***VMware Summary***

  It provides a summary of the entire vCenter environment. You can comprehensively check the status of the vCenter infrastructure.
