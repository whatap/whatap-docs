**Feature Project**<ScrollToLink anchor='feature-project' />

WhaTap newly introduced **Feature Project** (<code class='Features'>Features</code>) so that users can easily check whether the desired software supports monitoring and easily start monitoring. The Feature Project provides an optimized monitoring solution by repackaging existing monitoring products to fit the software to monitor. Manage your services for stability and performance more effectively through the WhaTap's Feature Project. 

:::

Apache Pulsar is a distributed messaging and streaming platform designed to efficiently process large amounts of real-time data. It provides high scalability and built-in multi-tenancy capability, and ensures reliability and flexibility through geographic replication and persistence of messages. Monitoring is critical to maintaining the performance and stability in the complex operating environment of Apache Pulsar. 

WhaTap provides the ***Apache Pulsar*** monitoring with a new **Feature Project** method. WhaTap allows you to trace the performance and status of the Apache Pulsar clusters in real time, enabling you to detect and resolve issues as early as possible, such as message latency, throughput degradation, and resource overload. 

- **Metrics Monitoring**: It provides various system metrics such as CPU and memory usage for each node, as well as critical operational indicators such as message throughput, latency, and queue sizes. 

- **Custom Dashboard**: You can view the metrics efficiently through this dashboard.

- **Alert Settings**: Alerts are sent in real time when the set conditions are detected, allowing users to quickly respond to the problems.

Effectively manage your complex operating environment of the Apache Pulsar cluster with the WhaTap ***Apache Pulsar*** monitoring.

  - ***CPU***: It displays the number of CPU cores used in the cluster.

  - ***Memory***: It displays the total amount of memory in use in the cluster and the current memory usage.

  - ***ZooKeeper***: It displays the number of running ZooKeeper instances and their availability.

  - ***Broker***: It displays the number and status of active brokers.

  - ***Bookies***: It displays the number and status of BookKeeper nodes (Bookies) used in Apache Pulsar.

  - ***Broker Storage Size***: It displays the total amount of data stored in the broker.

  - ***Backlog***: By displaying the total size of unprocessed messages to determine the delay in message processing.

  ##### Performance graphs

  - ***Messaging Storage***: It traces the storage capacity variability by displaying the message storage usage over time.

  - ***Message Rate(msg/s)***: It graphically displays the number of messages processed per second, allowing you to monitor the message processing speed of the cluster.

  - ***Messaging Backlog***: It visualizes the number of messages waiting to be processed over time, allowing you to quickly identify message processing delays.

  - ***Throughput(bytes/s)***: It represents the amount of data processed per second and evaluates the data processing capability of the cluster.

  - ***Replication Backlog***: It displays the number of messages waiting to be replicated to other data centers.

  - ***Replication Throughput***: It represents the amount of data processed per second during data replication.

  - ***Replication Rate***: It displays the transmission speed of replication messages.

  - ***Subscription Unacked Messages***: It represents the number of subscribed messages that have not yet been acknowledged.

  ##### Top 10 backlogs

  - ***Top 10 topics backlog***: You can analyze the causes of message delays by listing the top 10 topics with the most backlog.

  - ***Top 10 Replication Backlog***: You can identify replication latency issues by listing the top 10 items with the most replication backlog.
