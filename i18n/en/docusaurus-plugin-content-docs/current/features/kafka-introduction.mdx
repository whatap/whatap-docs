**Feature Project**<ScrollToLink anchor='feature-project' />

WhaTap newly introduced **Feature Project** (<code class='Features'>Features</code>) so that users can easily check whether the desired software supports monitoring and easily start monitoring. The Feature Project provides an optimized monitoring solution by repackaging existing monitoring products to fit the software to monitor. Manage your services for stability and performance more effectively through the WhaTap's Feature Project. 

:::

KAFKA is a distributed streaming platform optimized for processing, storing, and delivering real-time data feeds. KAFKA allows you to trace anomalies in data streams. Because KAFKA is a distributed system, it is required to check the status of each broker, topic, partition, producer, and consumer in more detail through monitoring. 

WhaTap provides the **_KAFKA_** monitoring with a new **Feature Project** method. It traces the overall performance and health of the KAFKA cluster to help you find and resolve issues early.

- **Metrics Monitoring**: It monitors various metrics of Kafka brokers, topics, partitions, producers, and consumers in real time.

- **Custom Dashboard**: You can view the metrics efficiently through this dashboard.

- **Alert Settings**: Alerts are sent in real time when the set conditions are detected, allowing users to quickly respond to the problems.

Effectively manage KAFKA’s complex operating environments through WhaTap's **_KAFKA_** monitoring.

## Installation

The following guides you to the basic installation method for using the WhaTap KFKA monitoring service. 

To use the WhaTap monitoring service, after [Sign up](https://www.whatap.io/en/signup/), create a project and then install the agent to the target server. For more information about membership registration, see [the following](../account/account-manage).

WhaTap's KAFKA Monitoring monitors various metrics for KAFKA brokers, topics, partitions, producers, and consumers in real time so that you can see the overall status of the KAFFKA cluster at a glance. You can check each metric regularly to keep your cluster in optimal health.

KAFKA **Custom Dashboard** provided by WhaTap consists of the following three presets: 

- **_Kafka Default_**

  This basic dashboard allows you to check whether the **cluster features are working properly**. It monitors the overall status of the KAFKA cluster in real time and helps detect performance degradation or any failures in advance.

  ##### Kafka Overview

  - **_Active Controller Count_**: Number of controllers that are active. The controllers manage the partition leaders and replication in the KAFKA cluster. Generally there is one active controller.

  - **_Brokers Online_**: It is the number of brokers that are online. A broker plays a role for storing messages and processing client requests.

  - **_Online Partitions_**: It is the number of partitions that are online. Each topic is divided into multiple partitions, and each partition is stored across multiple brokers.

  - **_Preferred Replica Imbalance_**: It indicates the imbalance in preferred replicas. A high value indicates that replicas are concentrated in specific brokers.

  - **_Under Replicated Partitions_**: It is the number of non-replicated partitions. If this value is not zero, there is a risk of data loss.

  - **_Leader Count per Broker_**: It indicates the number of leader partitions for each broker. The leader partition directly handles client requests.

  - **_Unclean Leader Elections_**: It is the abnormal number of leader elections. A high value indicates that there are cluster stability issues.

  - **_Under min ISR Partitions_**: It is the number of partitions below the minimum synchronized replicas (ISR). ISR ensures the data durability.

  - **_Offline Partitions Count_**: It is the number of partitions that are offline. When a partition is offline, you cannot access the data on that partition.

  - **_Broker Network Throughput_** `BytesOutPerSec`/`BytesInPerSec`: It indicates the broker's network throughput. It graphs the numbers of bytes sent/received per second.

  ##### Java Virtual Machine

  - **_CPU Usage_**: It displays the CPU utilization of the JVM. A high CPU utilization may affect the performance.

  - **_JVM Memory Used_**: It indicates how much memory the JVM is using. It displays a pattern of periodic memory increase and decrease after Garbage Collection (GC).

  - **_Time Spent in GC_**: It indicates the time spent in Garbage Collection (GC). Increased GC time can lead to poor performance.

  ##### Linux Disk I/O

  - **_Linux Disk Read Bytes_**: It indicates the number of read bytes on the disk. A high disk read/write volume can cause I/O bottleneck.

  - **_Linux Disk Write Bytes_**: It indicates the number of disk write bytes. As in reads, a high write volume can affect the performance.

  </details>

- **_Kafka Request_**

  With this dashboard, you can check the **throughput related to consumers and producers**. It monitors various performance metrics of the KAFKA cluster in real time to check the system health and help detect potential problems early as possible.

  ##### Processing Performance

  - **_Messages In_**: It indicates the number of messages received per second across the entire cluster.

  - **_Messages In per Broker_**: It indicates the number of messages received per second for each broker.

  - **Bytes In\***: It indicates the number of bytes received per second across the entire cluster.

  - **_Bytes In per Broker_**: It indicates the number of bytes received per second for each broker.

  - **_Request Queue Size_**: It indicates the size of the queue where unprocessed requests are queued. A larger queue size can lead to a longer response time.

  - **_Response Queue Size_**: It indicates the size of the queue where requests waiting for a response are queued. A large queue size can cause a delay.

  - **_Network Processor Avg Usage Percent_**: It indicates the average utilization of the network processor. It displays the load of network tasks.

  - **_Request Handler Avg Percent_**: It indicates the average utilization of the request handler. It displays the load for request processing.

  ##### Requests

  - **_Produce Request Per Sec_**: It indicates the number of producer requests generated per second. A high value indicates a lot of data is being sent to the broker.

  - **_Consume Fetch Request Per Sec_**: It indicates the number of consumer fetch requests generated per second. A high value indicates a lot of data is being sent to the consumer.

  - **_Broker Fetch Request Per Sec_**: It indicates the number of fetch requests between brokers. It displays internal traffic for data replication.

  - **_All Request Per Sec Across All Brokers_**: It indicates the number of requests per second processed by all brokers. It displays the request load across the entire cluster.

  ##### Errors

  - **_Errors Per Sec_**: It indicates the number of errors occurring per second. If there are many errors, it indicates that there may be system stability issues.

  ##### Offset Commit

  - **_Offset Commit Request Per Sec_**: It indicates the number of offset requests committed per second. The offset commit displays the position where the consumer group processed the message.

  ##### Metadata

  - **_Metadata Request Per Sec_**: It indicates the number of metadata requests per second. A metadata request indicates a request for the broker and partition information.

  ##### Topic

  - **_IsrShrinks per Sec_**: It indicates the number of synchronized replica (ISR) shrink events per second. As the ISR scales down, there may be data durability issues.

  - **_IsrExpands per Sec_**: It indicates the number of ISR expansion events per second. Data durability can be improved as the ISR expands.

  - **_Log size per Topic_**: It indicates the log size for each topic. It displays the size of topic data.

  - **_Log size per Broker_**: It indicates the log size for each broker. It displays the size of data stored in the broker.

  ##### Consume Lag

  - **_Lag_**: It indicates a delay in message consumption. This occurs when the consumer reads messages slower than the producer writes.

  </details>

- **_Kafka Broker_** 

  Using this dashboard, you can check the **broker performance**. It monitors the performance of the KAFKA cluster in real time and helps detect potential problems early as possible.
