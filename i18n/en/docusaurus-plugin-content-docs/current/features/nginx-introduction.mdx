WhaTap newly introduced **Feature Project** (<code class='Features'>Features</code>) so that users can easily check whether the desired software supports monitoring and easily start monitoring. The Feature Project provides an optimized monitoring solution by repackaging existing monitoring products to fit the software to monitor. Manage your services for stability and performance more effectively through the WhaTap's Feature Project.

NGINX is a high-performance HTTP and reverse proxy server that provides load balancing, caching, and HTTP cache features for web applications. NGINX is suitable for operating large-scale websites because it can effectively distribute and manage web traffic based on high concurrent processing performance.

WhaTap provides the ***NGINX*** monitoring with a new **Feature Project** method. It traces the overall performance and status of the NGINX server to help you find and resolve issues early as possible.

- **Metric Monitoring**: It monitors various metrics of the NGINX server in real time, including request processing status, response codes, and connection status.
