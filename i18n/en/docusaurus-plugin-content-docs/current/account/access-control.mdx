You can configure whether to allow access to the WhaTap service based on registered IP addresses.

* **When you register an IP as denied**, only the added IPs will be blocked.

1. In **Access Control**, check the **IP Access Control** list.  

1. Click the **+ Add IP** button and enter all the information (IP address, description, access permission).

    **Important Note When Registering Allowed IPs (Whitelist Mode)**  
    
    Once the allowlist is enabled, all access other than the registered IPs will be blocked. To prevent disruption, register the current operatorâ€™s IP address in the allowlist first.

1. Click the **Confirm** button to register the IP.  

### Delete IP Address

When deleting an IP address, the access permissions will change. Click the ![Delete Icon](/img/ic-delete-critical.svg) next to the IP you want to remove.  

* **When deleting an allowed IP**: IPs previously blocked will now be able to connect.  
* **When deleting a denied IP**: That IP will now be able to connect.
