**Multi-factor authentication** (**MFA**) authenticates users through multiple authentication processes. Multi-factor authentication can be used to enhance the security of accounts and services.

## Setting the multi-factor authentication

The WhaTap monitoring service (multi-factor authentication is used) provides the methods such as **_OTP_** and <Cmdname sid="email" className="uitext" />. OTP method is recommended.

:::note

** What is OTP?** It is the short for One Time Password that indicates an authentication method using a randomly generated one-time password rather than a fixed password.

:::

You can configure the multi-factor authentication by going to <Cmdname sid="MNU07360" className="uitext" /> in the following order.

1. Log in the WhaTap monitoring service (https://service.whatap.io).

2. Select the profile icon on the upper right of the screen. A drop-down menu appears.

3. Select <Cmdname sid="MNU07360" className="uitext" />.

4. Scroll down the page to go to the <Cmdname sid="two_factor_auth" className="uitext" /> section.

Select an authentication method of <Link to="#otp"><span class="uitext">OTP</span></Link> or <Link to="#email"><Cmdname sid="email" /></Link>.

## OTP authentication{#otp}

If OTP is selected as the multi-factor authentication method, be sure to install the OTP app on your mobile device.

- Android: Google OTP (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)
- iOS: Google Authenticator (https://apps.apple.com/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)

:::note

You can also perform OTP authentication through the WhaTap mobile app. For more information, see [the following](../mobile-app#mobileotp).

### Configuring the OTP-based multi-factor authentication

<ImgLang img='account-mfa-otp.png' desc='OTP authentication selection' />

1. Select <span class="uitext">OTP</span> as a multi-factor authentication method, and then select <Cmdname sid="create_otp_key" className="uitext" />.

2. Select <Cmdname sid="qr_code_url" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="otp_key" className="uitext" /> and then register the key on the OTP app of your mobile device.

   - To use the QR code, select **_Scan a QR code_** and then scan the QR code on your mobile device. (For convenience, it is recommended to use the QR code method.)

   :::note

   The recovery code is an alternative for your lost OTP key. Keep the downloaded recovery code file (_WhaTap-recovery-codes.txt_) in a safe place.

   :::

If you close the <Cmdname sid="TTL07396" className="uitext" /> window, the OTP-based multi-factor configuration is finished. Log out and then log in the service to check your multi-factor authentication settings.

:::note

For the method how to log in the service by using the recovery code, see [the following](#recoverycode).

4. Select <Cmdname sid="authentication" className="uitext" />.

In <Cmdname sid="MNU07360" className="uitext" />, go to the <Cmdname sid="two_factor_auth" className="uitext" /> section, and then attempt authentication with an email address or OTP key.
