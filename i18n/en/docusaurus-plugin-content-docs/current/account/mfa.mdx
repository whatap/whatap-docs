**Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** authenticates users through multiple authentication processes. Multi-factor authentication can be used to enhance the security of accounts and services.

## Setting the multi-factor authentication

The WhaTap monitoring service (multi-factor authentication is used) provides the methods such as **_OTP_** and **_email token_**. OTP method is recommended.

:::note
** What is OTP?** It is the short for One Time Password that indicates an authentication method using a randomly generated one-time password rather than a fixed password.

You can configure the multi-factor authentication by going to **_Manage Account INFO._** in the following order.

1.  Log in the WhaTap monitoring service (https://service.whatap.io).

2.  Select the profile icon on the upper right of the screen. A drop-down menu appears.
