**Multi-factor authentication** (**MFA**) authenticates users through multiple authentication processes. Multi-factor authentication can be used to enhance the security of accounts and services.

## Setting the multi-factor authentication

The WhaTap monitoring service (multi-factor authentication is used) provides the methods such as **_OTP_** and <Cmdname sid="email" className="uitext" />. OTP method is recommended.

:::note

** What is OTP?** It is the short for One Time Password that indicates an authentication method using a randomly generated one-time password rather than a fixed password.

:::

You can configure the multi-factor authentication by going to <Cmdname sid="manage_account_info" className="uitext" /> in the following order.

1.  Log in the WhaTap monitoring service (https://service.whatap.io).

2.  Select the profile icon on the upper right of the screen. A drop-down menu appears.

3.  Select <Cmdname sid="manage_account_info" className="uitext" />.

4.  Scroll down the page to go to the <Cmdname sid="two_factor_auth" className="uitext" /> section.
