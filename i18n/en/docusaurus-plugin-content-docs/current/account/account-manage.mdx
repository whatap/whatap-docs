:::note

For smooth withdrawal, check the following and then try again.

-   After withdrawal, all data such as project or promotion coupon are to be deleted and are not restored. It cannot be restored even after re-registration.

-   If there is any paid project, you can withdraw from the service only if there is no payment issue. You can check your unpaid amount in <Cmdname sid="my_usage" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="paymentHistory" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="my_usage" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="billingPreview" className="uitext" />.

-   If you have the **billing** role for the project, you can delegate the **billing** role to another member or delete the project for withdrawal. You can transfer the **billing** role to other members who have registered the billing information. For more information about the billing role transfer, see [the following](../about-billing).

-   If only you have the **Member Management** role in the project, delegate the **Member Management** role to another member for withdrawal. For more information about role modification, see [the following](../project/project-structure#modify-auth).

-   Be sure to decide carefully because the data of the deleted account cannot be reused or restored.
