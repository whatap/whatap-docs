It provides the options for HTTPC and API calls of the Python agent.

-   **profile_httpc_resource_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    When collecting HTTP call steps from the transaction trace, the CPU and memory usages in the step is traced.

-   **trace_httpc_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables the function to parse and normalize outbound HTTPC call URLs. 

-   **trace_httpc_normalize_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

    It normalizes the outbound HTTP call URLs after parsing them. The path parameters are deleted by parsing the call URL patterns. 

    For example, if declared as **/a/{v}/b**, **a/123/b** is replaced by **a/{v}/b**. To register multiple items, comma (,) is used as the delimiter. Using /a/\*/b, you can collect after deleting the path parameter with a specific format.
