## Enabling the virtual environment

While the applications are using [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/ko/3.7/library/venv.html), enable the virtual environment. Run the _bin/activate_ file.

## Download agent

Get the **access key** and then go to the <Cmdname sid="urlcheck-agent-setup-1-subject" className="uitext" /> section. Copy the following command to install the agent.

```bash
pip install whatap-python
```

:::tip

If installation is impossible with the pip command, download the installation file in [pypi WhaTap page](https://pypi.org/project/whatap-python/#files). Unzip the downloaded file and then proceed with installation.

```bash
tar xzvf whatap_python-1.x.x.tar.gz \
cd whatap_python-1.X.Y.Z \
python setup.py install
```

:::

### Agent structure file

The Python agent file consists of a tracer that extracts data for application monitoring and passes to the WhaTap collection server, and the elements that help the tracer send the data. For the agent file configuration, see the following.

<Filetree name="whatap">

<FiletreeItem name="agent" type="folder">A directory consisting of monitoring agent files that collect various performance metrics of the application server and transmit them to the server.</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="bootstrap" type="folder">A directory having the files that collect various data from the Python agents. It runs when the Python agent starts.</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="conf / control" type="folder">A directory that consists of the files for configuring and controlling the Python agent.</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="net / pack" type="folder">A directory that consists of the files related to UDP communication. It is responsible for transmitting the collected data to the server.</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="trace" type="folder">A directory that consists of the files that collect various transaction data for each application.</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="paramkey.txt" type="file">
  
  It is used to check the parameters of HTTP and SQL data collected as the trace information of the traced transactions. To store the security keys in a file and view the actual data in the browser, enter the security key saved in the file. You can modify your security key by manually changing the content of the file. For more information about related options, see the following:

  [profile_http_parameter_enabled](agent-transaction#profile_http_parameter)

  [profile_sql_param_enabled](agent-dbsql#profile-sql-param)

</FiletreeItem>

<FiletreeItem name="setup.py" type="file">Definition file for packaging the whatap directories.</FiletreeItem>

</Filetree>

## Agent CONFIG.

### WHATAP_HOME default path configuration

Specify the `$WHATAP_HOME` path for log and configuration files. It is recommended to create a new whatap directory.

```bash
$ export WHATAP_HOME=[PATH]
```

### Configuring the access key and collection server IP

Execute the `whatap-setting-config` command to set the access key and collection server IP.

```bash
$ whatap-setting-config \
--host [ COLLECTION_SERVER_IP ] \
--license [ ACCESS_KEY ] \
--app_name [ USER_DEFINED_AGENT_NAME ] \
--app_process_name [ APPLICATION_PROCESS_NAME(uwsgi, gunicorn etc..) ]
```

### Show Configuration

The *whatap.conf* file is created and set in the path specified in `$WHATAP_HOME`. Execute the following command to check whether the *whatap.conf* file has been created.

```bash
$ cat $WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf
```

```ini title="whatap.conf"
license=[ACCESS_KEY]
whatap.server.host=[COLLECTION_SERVER_IP]

# application name
app_name=[ USER_DEFINED_AGENT_NAME ]

# middleware process name ex)uwsgi, gunicorn ..
app_process_name=[ APPLICATION_PROCESS_NAME(uwsgi, gunicorn etc..) ]
```

:::note

**In case the role issue occurs**

- Read and write permissions of _$WHATAP_HOME/whatap.conf_ for configuration

- Read and write permissions of _$WHATAP_HOME/logs_ and the subordinate files for logging

If you have role issues for the `$WHATAP_HOME` path, execute the following command to assign roles.

```bash
echo `sudo chmod -R 777 $WHATAP_HOME`
```

## Applying by the application server environment

The application method may differ depending on the application server environment. Use the application method that suits your environment.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="command" label="Command">

In the **Command** environment, add the `whatap-start-agent` command before the application startup command as follows:

```bash title="BASH"
# $ whatap-start-agent [Application start command]
$ whatap-start-agent python manage.py runserver
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="uwsgi" label="uWSGI">

In the **uWSGI** environment, add the `whatap-start-agent` command before the `uwsgi` command as follows:

```bash title="BASH"
$ whatap-start-agent uwsgi --ini myapp.ini
```

When running applications by registering uWSGI with the service, see the following example code.

```bash title="/etc/init.d/uwsgi"
description "uWSGI application server handling myapp"
start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]
exec whatap-start-agent [YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND]
# or if you are using a virtual environment
exec env WHATAP_HOME=[PATH] [ABSOLUTE_PATH]/whatap-start-agent [YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND]
```

```ini title="/etc/init/uwsgi.conf"
...
NAME="uwsgi"
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/uwsgi
PID=$RUN/$NAME.pid
INI_PATH=/etc/$NAME/$NAME.ini

########## WHATAP_AGENT_CONF ##########

WHATAP_AGENT=[ABSOLUTE_PATH]/whatap-start-agent
...
do_start(){
  env WHATAP_HOME=$WHATAP_HOME $WHATAP_AGENT [YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND]
}
```

:::note

- If the user has been changed, you have to add the `WHATAP_HOME` environment variable.

- If the virtual environment has been used, add the agent startup command in the absolute path.

- Modify the service execution file (_/etc/init/uwsgi.conf_) and then start the application with the agent startup command.

- Depending on the user environment, the path of the service executable file may differ.

<TabItem value="gunicorn" label="Gunicorn">

In the **Gunicorn** environment, add the `whatap-start-agent` command before the `Gunicorn` command as follows:

```bash title=SH
$ whatap-start-agent gunicorn myapp.wsgi
```

When running applications by registering Gunicorn with the service, see the following example code.

```bash title="/etc/init.d/gunicorn"
description "gunicorn application server handling myapp"
start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]
exec whatap-start-agent [YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND]
# or if you are using a virtual environment
exec env WHATAP_HOME=[PATH] [ABSOLUTE_PATH]/whatap-start-agent [YOUR_APPLICATION_START_COMMAND]
```

```ini title="/etc/init/gunicorn.conf"
...
NAME="gunicorn"
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wsgi" label="WSGI">

Implementing your own WSGI application is provided. See the following:

```python title="PYTHON"
import whatap

@whatap.register_app
def simple_app(environ, start_response):
    """Simplest possible application object"""
    status = '200 OK'
    response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
    start_response(status, response_headers)
    return ['Hello world!\n']
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

In case of the application that is serviced to the docker container, add the following content to *Dockerfile*.

1. Installing the **Python agent**.

   ```docker title='Dockerfile' {3}
   ENV WHATAP_HOME /whatap
   RUN mkdir -p /whatap
   RUN pip install whatap-python
   ```

   :::note

   If you use _requirements.txt_, add **whatap-python** to that file.

   :::

2. Register the settings for **access key** and **collection server IP**.

   ```docker title='Dockerfile'
   RUN touch /whatap/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "license=[ ACCESS_KEY ]" > /whatap/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "whatap.server.host=[ COLLECTION_SERVER_IP ]" >> /whatap/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "app_name=[ AGENT_NAME ]" >> /whatap/whatap.conf
   RUN echo "app_process_name=[ APPLICATION_PROCESS_NAME(uwsgi, gunicorn etc..) ]" >> /whatap/whatap.conf
   ```

3. Before the previous command, `python manage.py runserver`, add `whatap-start-agent`.

   ```docker title='Dockerfile'
   CMD ["whatap-start-agent", "python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
   ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="code" label="Code">

You can apply the agent by adding the code that calls the API at the top line of the code as follows:

```python title="PYTHON"
import whatap
whatap.agent()
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

When you run the application server, the agent starts collecting the monitoring data.

## Checking the service running

Execute the following command to check whether the WhaTap Python service is running properly.

```bash
ps -ef | grep whatap_python
```
