## Arbitrary assignment and management of server names{#custom-naming}

The agent automatically assigns server names by using the type, IP, and service port of the application server.

### Application naming option

The default pattern can be modified in _whatap.conf_.

```bash
object_name default: {type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{process}
```

### Application naming pattern

The same name must not be used for registered application servers in the project. Do not use fixed server names. If the server IPs are duplicated due to the internal IP addresses, the application server names can be patterned and applied for each group.

**Pattern Options**

| Configuration | Description                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type          | app_name                                                            |
| ip#           | When IPs are divided by period (.), the #th digit (from 0) is used. |
| process       | app_process_name                                                    |
| hostname      | Host name                                                           |

## Open File Descriptor usage collection {#open-file-descriptor-usage-collection}

Monitoring the Open File Descriptor usage by the Python web application is essential for managing system resources. File descriptors are critical resources that limit the number of files that can be opened simultaneously on the system. If the usage reaches the limit, the application cannot open new files, which can cause errors. This problem frequently happens in multi-threaded and multi-process environments.

Additionally, the file descriptor leakage may degrade system performance and compromise stability due to resource exhaustion. This feature monitors and identify the file descriptor usage status when its usage is high and helps you increase the file descriptor limitation or resolve the leakage issues if necessary.

:::note 

**Requirements**

WhaTap Python agent 1.7.2 or later is required.

### Activation options

Modify the _whatap.conf_ file referencing the following example. 

```ini
#Setting the collection feather to on or off
open_file_descriptor_enabled=true

#Default value is set to 60 seconds when the collection cycle is omitted
open_file_descriptor_interval=60
```

### Collection metrics

| Name                 | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `current_nofile_pct` | Usage rate of the current Open File Descriptor (%)             |
| `currnet_nofile`     | Number of current open file descriptors                        |
| `max_nofile`         | Number of allowed maximum open file descriptors of the process |
| `pid`                | Process ID                                                     |

## Applying the AES 256 encryption

The WhaTap application monitoring agent transfers the collected data after encryption. You can change this depending on the importance of the data or setting.  

By default, it uses XOR operation and the encryption using AES algorithm. Encryption and decryption are performed by dividing the plain texts into 128-bit units. It can be expanded up to 256 bits depending on the setting.

1. **Set up**

   In the directory where the agent has been installed, add the following settings to _whatap.conf_.

   ```ini title='whatap.conf'
   license={access key}
   whatap.server.host={collection server IP}
   cypher_level=256
   ```

2. **Restart**

   After adding the settings, restart the WAS.

## Constraints

### Multiple regions impossible to be selected as a single project

In [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io), when **_creating a project_**, you cannot select multiple regions. When using multiple regions, create separate projects.

If servers exist in multiple regions as in the cloud environment, the collection servers must be located in each region to avoid constraints on the performance data collection such as network latency. WhaTap builds collection servers for each region to meet customer requirements.

### Duplicate agent names (ONAME) impossible to be used

WhaTap application monitoring uses the IP address and port to identify agents. If the application server to be monitored in the user environment uses the same IP and port, the WhaTap server cannot identify the server instances.

If the server instance is not dynamically expanded, it can be bypassed by directly assigning a name for identifying applications by seeing [the following](#custom-naming).

If the applications to be monitored use internal addresses or duplicate IPs due to network virtualization, use separate application naming patterns by seeing [the following](#custom-naming).
