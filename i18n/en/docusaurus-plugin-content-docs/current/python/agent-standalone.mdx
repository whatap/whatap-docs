Standalone Python refers to an independent executable process where a pure *.py* script runs directly through the Python interpreter without a web framework or runtime environment.

In this non-HTTP environment, monitoring must be configured via options in the *whatap.conf* file.

* **standalone_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default: `false`

    Standalone monitoring is only available when this option is set to `true` in `whatap.conf`.

## Standalone Type Setting

* **standalone_type** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default: `single-transaction`

    Choose one of: `single-transaction`, `multiple-transaction`

    * `single-transaction`
    
        * Monitors the execution of the Python script as a single transaction.
        * The service name is registered using the name of the executed script file.
    
        ```bash
        whatap-start-agent test.py
        # â†’ Registered as transaction name "test.py"
        ```

    * `multiple-transaction`

        * Tracks transactions by setting points at the user-specified module, class, or method level.

        ```bash title="Tracking by class"
        standalone_transaction_patterns = "package:Class.method"
        # Example: myPackage:MyClass.__init__
        ```

        ```bash title="Tracking by function"
        standalone_transaction_patterns = "package:function"
        # Example: myPackage:my_function
        ```

    :::tip

    When tracking functions or classes in the main script file, use `__main__` instead of the package name.

    * Python interpreter always recognizes the main script as the `__main__` module.

    ```bash title="Example"
    whatap-start-agent test.py
    ```

    * In this case, the script *test.py* will be recognized as the `__main__` module.

    ```bash
    # Correct example
    standalone_transaction_patterns = "__main__:my_function"

    # Incorrect example
    standalone_transaction_patterns = "test:my_function"
    ```
