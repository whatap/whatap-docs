## Creating the monitoring account

To monitor CUBRIDs, you need both a DB account and a CUBRID Manager account. Use `dba` for the DB account. Use the following command for the CUBRID Manager account.

```sql title="CUBRID Manager account"
cm_admin adduser whatap whatap
```

:::note

Each agent must use an account with a different name.

## Setting the XCUB agent {#setxcubagent}

The XCUB agent runs a separate process on the database server to collect SQL text and metrics. It is recommended to install it together with the XOS agent.

<ImgLang img="xcub-install-agent.svg" multi="true" className="noneborder" />

### Configuring the whatap.conf file

Set the agent options in the *whatap.conf* file as follows:

```ini title="whatap.conf"
xcub=1
xcub_port=3002
```

Copy the _xcub_ folder (`/unzipped folder/xcub/`) inside the DBX agent installation path to the database server.

:::note

If you install the XOS agent together, you do not need to set the `xcub_port` option because it shares the XOS port.

:::

### Configuring the xcub.conf file

Enter the DBX agent server information in the _xcub.conf_ file located in the xcub folder for the database server, and then set additional options.

```ini titile="xcub.conf"
db=demodb@127.0.0.1
dba_pwd={dba_password}
dbx_ip={DB_Agent_IP}
dbx_port=3002
```

- Enter the value in the format of `db`: **dbname@dbServerIP**.

- `dbapwd: Once a password has been set, the *xcub.pwd* file is created at initial execution. After that, delete the `dba_pwd\` entry in the _xcub.conf_ file.

- `dbx_ip`: Enter the IP address of the server in which the DBX agent has been installed.

- `dbx_port`: Set the port to communicate with the DBX agent. DBX agent can be communicated via UDP. If you have set a firewall on that port, disable it for UDP communication.

:::note

For more information about the XCUB agent configuration, see [the following](agent-xcub-settings).

:::

### Assigning the role for executing he XCUB agent

Assign the role to run the XCUB agent.

```bash
chmod +x ./whatap.agent.xcub*
```

### XCUB agent execution

Execute the ACUB agent process on the database server.

```bash
./start.sh
```

:::note

To run the XCUB agent in the background, run the _./startd.sh_ file.
