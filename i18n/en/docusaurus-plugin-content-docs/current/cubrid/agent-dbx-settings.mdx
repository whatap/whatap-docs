Write the settings for the DBX agent in the *whatap.conf* file. For the options that can be set, see the following.

## Default options

import Dbagentdbxbasicoption from "../common-items/_db-agent-dbx-basic-option.mdx";

<Dbagentdbxbasicoption />

## CUBRID-dedicated options{#cubrid}

- **db_port** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `0`

  Broker port information used for application connection information. Enter the value defined in `BROKER_PORT` in the broker configuration file (_cubrid_broker.conf_). (CUBRID default `BROKER_PORT: 33000`)

- **cms_port** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `8001`

  This port is used by **CUBRID Manager**. In the **CUBRID Manager** configuration file (_cm.conf_), enter the value defined in `cm_port`. It is necessary to fetch monitoring information through the API of **CUBRID Manager**.

- **cms_token_file** <span class='type'>String</span>

  If there are multiple DBs created by the user, WhaTap agents must have been installed and set as many as the number of DBs. In this case, the `cms_token_file` path is required to share tokens between agents. Set to _`{Agent installation path}`/cms_token_. 

  For example) If agent2 has been installed, set as follows to share the `cms_token_file` path of agent1.

  ```ini title='whtap.conf'
  cms_token_file=/agent1/cms_token
  ```

- **broker** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `broker1`, `query_editor`

  Once CUBRID has been installed, the broker runs as `broker1` and `query_editor` by default. If you arbitrarily changed the name of the broker or started it additionally, enter the changes.

  :::note

  The name to set with the `broker` option can be viewed by the `cubrid broker status` command.
