The database monitoring has been installed completely. Check the checklist after installation.

## Running the agent

Run the _start.sh_ shell script file or the _start.bat_ batch file from the installation path of the database agent. When you run the agent, it starts collecting monitoring data from the database. Check the agent log to see whether the agent has started.

```bash title='start.sh'
$ ./start.sh

Just Tap, Always Monitoring
WhaTap DBX version 1.3.9 20181120
```

## Checking the agent process

You can check the status of the active WhaTap DBX agent process with the following command.

```bash title='SH'
$ ps –ef | grep dbx
```

## Checking the log

If the log appears normally when restarting the service, you can check that the agent has been installed successfully. After registering the agent, the collection-related log can be checked in the _$WHATAP_HOME/logs_ path. If the agent runs normally, check the following log files on the date.

-   whatap-DBX-`OID`-`DATE`
-   whatap-boot-`DATE`.log

## Checking the monitoring

To check that the log has been normally uploaded from the server and the console has been registered normally, go to the initial screen of [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io). Select the project to check and then select **_Management_** > **_Agent List_** on the left. From **_Agent List_**, you can check the name of the database server. To set the names of database servers separately, see [the following](agent-manage).
