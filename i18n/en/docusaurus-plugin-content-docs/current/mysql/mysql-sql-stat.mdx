SQL statistical data (execution count, execution time, number of rows, etc.) provided by MySQL's `performance_schema` is collected through the `performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest` view. 

:::note

- Delta values are calculated and collected from `events_statements_summary_by_digest` at 1-hour intervals. Therefore, collection begins one hour after configuration.

- When collecting data every 1 hour, up to 5,000 cases are collected based on the `sum_timer_wait`. 

- This function is supported in DBX agent 1.6.10 or later.

- For more information about the `events_statements_summary_by_digest` view, see [the following link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.html).

:::

:::tip

- The `events_statements_summary_by_digest` view is affected by the value (number of rows) of a database parameter called `performance_schema_digests_size`. If the parameter value is set to `-1`, auto sizing is made. 

- Data is stored according to the set parameter values. When the set capacity is exceeded, new data is no longer collected. 

- If you initialize the view with the `TRUNCATE` command, all collected data is deleted and new data is recorded.

## Before use

To use <Cmdname sid="side_mysqlStat" className="uitext" />, the following settings are required in the target monitoring DB.

1. Enable **Performance Schema** in the database configuration (_my.cnf_).

   ```ini title='my.cnf'
   performance_schema = on
   ```

2. Set the view role to allow the monitoring account to read the data.

   ```bash
   grant select on performance_schema.* to whatap;
   ```

3. Set the options in the DBX agent.

   ```ini title='whatap.conf'
   statements=true
   ```

:::note

See the following DBX agent options for the criteria on how to collect data. It views `performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest` and performs collection if the sum is greater than `statements_min_row`.

> `sum_rows_affected` + `sum_rows_sent` + `sum_rows_examined`

```ini title="whatap.conf"
# default 10000 row
statements_min_row=10000
```
