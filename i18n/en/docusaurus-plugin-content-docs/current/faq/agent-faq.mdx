### Monitoring agent name duplication issue

> Why are agent names duplicated in the Scale In/Out environment?

In the Scale In/Out environment, instances or containers are automatically added or removed depending on the resource demand. During this process, if the monitoring agents installed on each instance use a fixed name, the newly created instance may use the same name as that of existing instances, which may cause duplication issues. This happens frequently when instances are self-recovered or continuous release is happening in the DevOps environment.

> What is the resolution for the agent name duplication issue?

The WhaTap agent provides the agent configuration that allows you to create a unique identifier by setting variables whenever each instance or container is restarted. You can apply the `whatap.name` option to the *whatap.conf* file for agent configuration. See the following example:

```ini title="whatap.conf"
whatap.name={Job name}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{port}
```

For example, if `{job name}` is "service," the IP address is **10.11.12.13** and the port number is `8000`, the agent name is assigned with `service-12-13-8000`.

- `{ipN}`: Name is assigned using each Nth unit of the IPv4 address. `N` begins with 0. 

  :::tip

  If the IP address is 10.11.12.13, the following is applied depending on the specified variable.

  `{ip0}`: 10, `{ip1}`: 11, `{ip2}`: 12, `{ip3}`: 13

  :::

- `{port}`: Name is assigned using the port number to which the application listens.

:::note

For more information about agent configuration to identify agent names, see [the following](../java/agent-name).
