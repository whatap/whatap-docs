### Restoration of the original log

> Can I recover the original logs after collecting them?

The function to restore the original logs is not provided. Currently, log collection is provided for analysis, not for security.

### Log data deletion cycle

> What is the log data deletion cycle?

It is the same as **_Data retention_** set in **_Log Configuration_**. However, because the loaded log retention period is in hours, data may remain for 1 hour in addition to the setting in **_Data retention_**.

:::note

If **_Data retention_** has not been set, the default value is 1 day. For more information about the setting in **_Data retention_**, see [the following](../log/log-setting#log-data-setting).

:::

### Agent logs transmission cycle

> What is the log transmission cycle from the agent?

Logs are sent when the agent's log buffer capacity (64 KB) or transmission cycle (2 seconds) is reached. It is compressed in a _zip_ file and transmitted during network transmission, and is decompressed and stored when received from the collection server.

### Integrating with third-party log solutions

> Can it integrate with other log solutions?

Currently, integration with third-party log solutions is not provided.

### Log Collection by Platform

> How can I collect logs for applications, servers, and Kubernetes?

Log collection by platform is as follows.

<details>
<summary>**JAVA**</summary>

The logs are collected by hooking in the `log4j` and `logback` log libraries.

:::note

When using `logback` or `log4j`, you may need to set options for Appender-based log collection. For more information, see the [Open source tracing](../java/agent-weaving#지원-오픈소스-목록) document in WhaTap Docs.

:::

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Node.js**</summary>

By hooking the built-in package process of Node.js, the logs for `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` are collected.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Python**</summary>

The logs are collected by hooking in the `logging` and `loguru` log libraries.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**PHP / Server**</summary>

Collection is made by specifying the log files to monitor.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Go**</summary>

- Collection is made by specifying the log files to monitor.

- The `Standard out` and `Standard error` logs are collected for applications.

:::note

To collect logs for standard outs and errors, extra settings are required.\
For more information, see the [Go Monitoring > API Guide](../golang/api-guide) document in WhaTap Docs.

<summary>**Kubernetes**</summary>

1. **Container StdOut**

   The WhaTap Kubernetes agent collects <strong>Container's standard output logs (Container stdout/stderr)</strong>.
   These logs are collected using two methods, depending on the purpose of use.

   - **Logfile-based collection**

       This method directly reads log files stored in the file system of the Kubernetes node.\
       The collected logs can be checked using the <Cmdname sid="side_log" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_logExplorer" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="side_logSearch" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="side_logTail" className="uitext" /> features.

     ```ini title="와탭 에이전트 로그 파일 수집 경로"
     /var/log/pods/<namespace>_<pod-name>_<uid>/<container-name>/*.log
     ```

     ```ini title="예시"
     /var/log/pods/whatap_agent_7ddf2a4c-0877-4602-a38c-df07c4501ede/agent/0.log
     ```

       :::caution

       If logs are not collected, connect to the node and then check if the log files exist in the above path. For more information about the log collection filters, see the [Kubernetes 모니터링 > 로그](../kubernetes/log#containerStdOut-로그-필터-설정) document in WhaTap Docs.

   - **Real-time lookup via kube-apiserver**

       When you click a specific container in the container map, the Kubernetes API (kube-apiserver) is called in a way similar to the kubectl logs command to load the container logs in real time.

       This method is useful for quickly checking the container status, but it does not provide the search or long-term retention feature.

     | Log location       | `/var/log/pods/<namespace><pod-name><uid>/<container-name>/*.log`                  | Call the kube-apiserver API     |

2. **K8s Event**

   The Kubernetes event collection logs are collected after checking via the kubectl get events.
