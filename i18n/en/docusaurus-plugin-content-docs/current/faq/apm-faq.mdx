<div className='faqs'>

### After Springboot update, some widget items do not appear.

> After Springboot update, the information of the <Cmdname sid="AA005" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="today_user" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="today_tps" className="uitext" /> widgets does not appear in <Cmdname sid="side_appDashboard" className="uitext" />.

If the data of some widgets does not appear in <Cmdname sid="side_appDashboard" className="uitext" /> after updating the Springboot, check the following.

- **Agent setting**

  Set the following options and then restart the application.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  weaving=spring-boot-3.0
  ```

- If you are using **Java 17 or later**, add the following options related to the reflection.

  ```java
  --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
  ```

:::note

The metrics of the <Cmdname sid="today_user" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="today_tps" className="uitext" /> widget displays a chart in the widget by using the 1-hour statistical data. Because statistical data is created over time after making the above settings, the data may not be visible immediately.

### The Stop thread button does not work.

> There is no response when I press <Cmdname sid="stop_thread" className="uitext" />. Are extra settings required?

The <Cmdname sid="stop_thread" className="uitext" /> feature forcibly terminates threads running in the application. However, this feature may not work in all cases. For example, if a thread is performing IO operations, the thread cannot be stopped immediately.

If you use the <Cmdname sid="stop_thread" className="uitext" /> feature, an attempt to terminate the thread is followed even if it is performing IO operations. However, the thread is not terminated until the thread completes its IO operations. The thread accepts a termination request but does not stop its operation until its operation is completed and it moves to the next work.

In this case, forcible termination of the thread is not recommended because it may cause problems with business logic and cause unexpected operations. If you still need to terminate the thread, stop and restart the entire application.

### 'Lost Connection' message

> In the transaction trace information, it is displayed as 'Lost Connection', and it is not possible to check the details of which process has been run and ended.

In Application Monitoring for **PHP**, **Python**, **.NET**, and **Go** products, information on the transactions that have not been terminated within 5 minutes (default: `300000`) is not collected. The 'Lost Connection' message is left in the trace history. 

To collect the trace data for transactions that are delayed more than 5 minutes, set the following option value to `300000` or higher.

```ini title="whatap.ini"
# PHP
whatap.trace_active_transaction_lost_time=300000

#Python, .NET, Go
trace_active_transaction_lost_time=300000
```

### Number of concurrent users / number of visitors

> What is the difference between the concurrent user count and the visitor count?

**Number of concurrent users** and **Number of visitors** differ in their calculation methods and purposes. 

**Number of concurrent users** is a metric that measures how many users are using the applications at a specific point. It is the average of users who have made requests over the last 5 minutes, calculated without duplicates, at 10-second intervals. This metric displays how many users are connecting in a short period and can be used to see the real-time load on the server.

**Number of visitors** is the sum of **numbers of concurrent users** connected over 1 hour without duplication. This metric is used to measure the number of unique users who visited a website or application over a specific period and is primarily used for traffic analysis and user engagement evaluation.

The numbers for concurrent users and visitors can be checked in the following menu path.

- <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_appDashboard" className="uitext" />

  The <Cmdname sid="dashboard_user" className="uitext" /> widget allows you to check the number of concurrent users in real time, collected at an interval of 10 seconds.

- <Cmdname sid="side_analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_metricsChart" className="uitext" />

  In <Cmdname sid="user" className="uitext" /> of the <Cmdname sid="product_type_apm" className="uitext" /> category, select <Cmdname sid="realtime_user" className="uitext" /> (5-minute statistics) or <Cmdname sid="visitor" className="uitext" /> (1-hour total).

- <Cmdname sid="side_analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_metricsSearch" className="uitext" />

  - **Number of concurrent users**: In the <Cmdname sid="category" className="uitext" /> option, select `app_user` and then check the value of the `realtime_user` field.

  - **Number of visitors**: In the <Cmdname sid="category" className="uitext" /> option, select `visitor` and then check the value of the `visit_user` field.

:::note

- Real-time (concurrent access) users indicate the users who are using the system in the same time zone. There are various ways to count or measure real-time (concurrent access) users.

- In general, the connected user means a connected user who has access to the current network. However, web systems are different because they use connectionless networks. It does not mean that you are connected, but rather the user who sent the recent request can be measured.

- The number of users is calculated by ** HyperLogLog** rather than simply adding up.

- In the agent settings, the IP or cookies can be used to distinguish users. For more information, see [the following](../java/metrics-performance-counter#user-counter).
