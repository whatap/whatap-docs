This is the common FAQ document used when using the WhaTap monitoring service.

<div className="faqs">

### Data according to the data query range

> Why isn't real-time data displayed when I query long-term data?

WhaTap displays different data formats depending on the data query range. As the query range gets wider, the data aggregation interval also gets longer.

- **Less than 3 hours**: Real-time data at 5-second intervals

- **3 hours to 15 days**: Statistical data at 5-minute intervals

- **16 days or more**: Statistical data at 1-hour intervals

### Changed the agent data collection project {#agent-project-change}

> How can I change my Agent data collection project? 

After modifying the **collection server IP** and **project access key** in the *whatap.conf* file within the WhaTap Agent installation directory, restart the agent. **Collection Server IP** and **Project Access Key** can be found in the <Cmdname sid="side_management" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_agentSetting" className="uitext" /> menu on the WhaTap service screen. 

```bash
whatap.server.host= # Collection server IP
license= # Project Access Key
```

:::note

For Kubernetes monitoring products, see [the following](/kubernetes/k8s-collection-server-ip).

#### Application of the Multiple Agent

For application and server monitoring products, you can change multiple agent settings at once by selecting the ***Apply Multiple Agents*** option in the <Cmdname sid="side_agentSetting" className="uitext" /> menu. 

**If deployed in the container environment** You have to modify the *whatap.conf* file within the image containing the Whatap agent, and rebuild and redeploy the image to apply the changes. Note that the previous image settings are kept when making changes in the UI.

### Event duration time

> Why doesn't the event get resolved after occurrence?

Check the **Duration (number of occurrences)** setting of the occurred event. The duration (number of occurrences) setting for events applies not only when the event occurs, but also when it is resolved. If the set conditions are not met, the event is not resolved and is maintained. 

e.g. if the condition (number) for transaction error events is 10 cases and the duration is 30 seconds\
An event occurs when the number of transaction errors exceeds 10 and continues for 30 seconds, and the event is resolved when the number of errors is 10 or less and continues for 30 seconds.
