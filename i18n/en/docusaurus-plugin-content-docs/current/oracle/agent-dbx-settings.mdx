<V2Note product="Oracle" />

Write the settings for the DBX agent in the *whatap.conf* file. For the options that can be set, see the following.

## Default options

import Dbagentdbxbasicoption from "../common-items/_db-agent-dbx-basic-option.mdx";

<Dbagentdbxbasicoption />

## Collecting data {#collect-data}

- **conn_fail_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `15`

  It sends a notification when 15 consecutive connection errors occur. You can adjust the notification occurrence criteria by entering the desired number.

- **db_param_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It sets whether or not to collect the DB parameters.

- **event** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default: 

  <details>

  <summary>Viewing all 8 events</summary>

    `db file scattered read`, `db file sequential read`, `direct path read`, `direct path write`,\
    `enq: TX - row lock contention`, `latch free`, `library cache lock`, `library cache pin`

  </details>

  In the RAC environment, two additional metrics are collected by default: gc cr block receive time and gc current block receive time.

  The values for the above metrics are collected from `v$system_event`. You can check it in the db_oracle_counter category, which collects the following three values ​​for a single event.

  - time waited: Total time (1/100 seconds) waited for the event e.g. db file sequential read time waited
  - timeouts: Number of waits that ended in timeout e.g. db file sequential read total timeouts
  - total waits: Total number of the events occurred e.g. db file sequential read total waits

  cf.) In Oracle Pro, you can set additional metrics other than the defaults by writing in the manner of `event+=`. However, this product does not support it.

- **interval_sec** <span class='type'>Boolean</span> <code class="my">DBX agent v1.7.3 or later</code>

  Default `true`

  This option is used to convert the data collected from the agent every 5 seconds in seconds (`delta` value for 1 second) and report it.

- **ora_bind_saving** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  If the SQL execution time is more than 5 seconds, the bind value of the SQL is collected by `v$sql_bind_capture`. (excluding the sys account)

  cf.) In Oracle Pro, the options are divided into bind_interval, bind_max_count, and bind_elapse.

- **ora_plan_saving** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  If the SQL plan has changed or the SQL execution time is more than 5 seconds, the plan information is collected from `v$sql_plan`. (excluding the sys account)

  cf.) In Oracle Pro, the options are divided into plan_change and plan_elapse.

- **ora_ratio** <span class='type'>Boolean</span> <code class="my">DBX agent v1.6.11 or later</code>

  Default `false`

  You can additionally collect various ratio metrics. The metrics to collect are as follows:

  - `buffer cache hit ratio`
  - `soft parse ratio`
  - `hard parse ratio`
  - `library cache hit ratio`
  - `library cache pin hit ratio`
  - `library cache get hit ratio`
  - `latch hit ratio`
  - `shared pool free mem ratio`

- **segments** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It collects the segment size information. In <Cmdname sid="side_reportStat" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_tableSpace" className="uitext" />, you can see the size by selecting the database or tablespace.

- **segments_exclude_sys** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  The sizes are collected except for accounts corresponding to sys.

- **segments_hour** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `5`

  It sets the time to collect segment sizes. The default value is `5` and collection starts at 5 AM.

- **segments_max_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `50`

  Only 50 large segments are collected and stored for each tablespace.

- **segments_min_size** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `10`

  The minimum unit for collecting segment sizes is 10 MB by default. When collecting the segment sizes, the segment sizes less than the set value are not collected.

- **segments_sys** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default: 

  <details>
    <summary>Viewing all 18 accounts</summary>

    `SYS`, `OUTLN`, `SYSTEM`, `AUDSYS`, `DBSNMP`, `GSMADMIN_INTERNAL`,\
    `XDB`, `WMSYS`, `OJVMSYS`, `CTXSYS`, `ORDSYS`, `ORDDATA`,\
    `MDSYS`, `LBACSYS`, `DVSYS`, `DBSFWUSER`, `APPQOSSYS`, `OLAPSYS`  

  </details>

  It is the list of accounts corresponding to sys. To add to the above account, write additionally including the above content with `segments_sys='xxx','xxx','xxx'`.

- **stat** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default: 

  <details>

  <summary>Viewing all 22 metrics</summary>

    `consistent gets`, `cpu used by this session`, `db block changes`, `db block gets`, `db time`,\
    `data blocks consistent reads - undo records applied`, `enqueue waits`, `execute count`,\
    `logons current`, `opened cursors current`, `parse count (hard)`, `parse count (total)`,\
    `physical reads`, `physical writes`, `redo entries`, `rollback changes - undo records applied`,\
    `session logical reads`, `sorts (disk)`, `sorts (memory)`, `transaction tables consistent reads - undo records applied`,
    `user commits`, `user rollbacks`

  </details>

  The values for the above metrics are collected from `v$sysstat`. You can check it in the db_oracle_counter category.

  cf.) In Oracle Pro, you can set additional metrics other than the defaults by writing in the manner of `stat+=`. However, this product does not support it.

- **xview_min_sec** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `0`

  When collecting xview, it is collected only when the query execution time takes longer than the specified time. By default, it collects all queries whose execution time takes more than 0 seconds.
