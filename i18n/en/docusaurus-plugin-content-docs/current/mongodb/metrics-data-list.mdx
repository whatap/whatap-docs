Database metrics are comprehensive data collected for database workloads and resource usages. The WhaTap monitoring service continuously collects metrics to identify bottlenecks in the database and provides data to help identify the root causes of performance issues.

MongoDB collects key metrics from `db.serverStatus`, and the following lists the descriptions for the collected key metrics: For more information about other metrics, see [the following](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/#output/).

import AgentStatus from "../common-items/_agent-status-summary-metrics.mdx";
