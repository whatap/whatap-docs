## Learning about the main widgets {#about-widget}

The types of widgets that can be placed on the dashboard are as follows.

- **_DB Status_**

  You can see the status of agents (instances) in the project. Individual agents are displayed in a hexagon. If you hover your mouse over it, the current status and IP address appear.

  ![DB Status](/img/db-dashboard-status-widget.png)

  The status of the agent can be classified as follows:

  - <span class='normal'>Normal</span>: Number of normal agents.

  - <span class='mstop'>Inactive Agents</span>: Number of disconnected agents.

- **_Clusters_**

  You can see the status of Master and Slave instances.

- **_Instantaneous Ops Per Sec_**

  ![Instantaneous Ops Per Sec](/img/db-dashboard-instaneous-widget.png)

  It displays the number of commands per second (`instantaneous_ops_per_sec`) processed by the server using a pie chart. It can be used as a metric to compare and monitor the performance between multiple instances.

  :::tip

  The `instantaneous_ops_per_sec` metric indicates the number of commands per second that the server processes. This is useful for tracing and monitoring the workload that your instances are currently handling. The number of commands per second indicates the amount of commands the server receives and processes. It helps you check the server's workload and identify performance issues.

  :::

- **_Key Status_**

  It monitors the server's key status. It is necessary to understand the database running status and optimize its performance.

  - **_Evicted Keys_**: Displays the number of cached or stored keys that have expired or deleted according to the memory policy. If the **_Evicted Keys_** metric increases, there may be an issue of insufficient memory or a cache policy issue.

  - **_Expired Keys_**: Displays the number of expired keys. In Redis, you can set the expiration time for keys, and the expired keys are deleted automatically. If the **_Expired Keys_** metric increases, you may need to review the expiration policy in the database or check user behaviors.

  - **_Keyspace Hits_**: Displays the number of successful requests to find in cache or memory while retrieving and loading keys from the database. The metric helps you evaluate the cache efficiency and understand the access patterns to keys.

  - **_Keyspace Misses_**: Displays the number of unsuccessful requests to find in cache or memory while retrieving and loading keys from the database. The metric helps you evaluate the cache efficiency and take measures for performance improvement.

  :::note

  In the Redis database, the keys include various data types such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and ordered sets.

  :::

- **_Connected Clients_** (`connected_clients`)

  Number of the connected clients. You can see the number of concurrent connections to the server. A rapid increase in the number of client connections to the server can indicate an unexpected increase in traffic or other issues. Accordingly, you need to recognize and respond quickly to the issues.

- **_Used Memory_** (`used_memory`)

  Amount of memory (bytes) requested for data saving. There may be a difference from the amount of memory allocated by the OS. If the `used_memory` metric is too high, it may be required to review the memory management policy and optimize the dataset to reduce the memory usage.

- **_Total Commands_** (`total_commands_processed`)

  A widget that displays the total number of commands processed after the server startup. It represents the cumulative number of all commands performed by the server and includes the number of requests from all clients processed while providing services. The `total_commands_processed` metric is useful for finding the level of server activities and evaluating the performance. This metric increases over time and you need to continuously monitor the activity level of the server by tracing value changes.

- **_Used CPU_** (`used_cpu`)

  Redis uses a single CPU per instance and displays the allocated CPU usage. The `used_cpu` metric can help you understand how the server uses CPU resources. If this metric increases to an unexpected level, it is required to recognize any performance issue and optimize the performance.

- **_Commands(/S)_** (`instantaneous_ops_per_sec`)

  It displays the number of commands per second (`instantaneous_ops_per_sec`) processed by the server for each instance over time through the time series chart. This widget is useful for monitoring trends over time and identifying performance trends and issues.

  :::tip

  The `instantaneous_ops_per_sec` metric indicates the number of commands per second that the server processes. This is useful for tracing and monitoring the workload that your instances are currently handling. The number of commands per second indicates the amount of commands the server receives and processes. It helps you check the server's workload and identify performance issues.

- **_Total Net Input Bytes_**

  Widget that displays the total amount of network input (bytes) received by the server. It measures the total amount of all network traffic received from clients. This widget helps you see how much network bandwidth the clients have consumed while communicating with the server. It may be useful for tracing the client activity levels and managing the network load.

- **_Blocked Clients_** (`blocked_clients`)

  It displays the number of clients in a blocked state on the server. A blocked client is waiting for specific tasks on the server and the client is blocked until the pending task is completed. You can monitor how many clients are in a blocked state. This metric allows you to easily see the current load status of the server.

- **_Keys Total_** (`keys_total`)

  Total number of keys saved in the Redis database. The keys include various data types such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and ordered sets. By tracing the overall amount of data saved in the database, you can see the database size and trace the data growth trend. If this metric rapidly increases, you may need to allocate additional memory or review the data cleaning policy.

- **_Evicted Keys_** (`evicted_keys`)

  Number of keys removed due to the database's maxmemory limit. The removal policy is based on the `maxmemory-policy` setting in the configuration file. In general, the `evicted_keys` metric increases when the validity period of the key data expires or the key is deleted due to insufficient memory. By monitoring the `evicted_keys` metric, you can trace how often keys are deleted and identify the memory usage and performance.

- **_Keyspace Hits_** (`keyspace_hits`)

  Number of successful key inquiry requests. If the value `get key` exists, it is incremented by 1. Hit Rate can be calculated as (`keyspace_hits` / (`keyspace_hits` + `keyspace_misses`) \* 100 ). The `keyspace_hits` metric is one of the important metrics for evaluating the cache efficiency and performance of the database server.

- **_Rdb Changes Since Last Save_**

  A widget that represents the amount of data changed after the last `SAVE` command. By tracing the amount of changed data, you can see the changed amount of data. If you have a large amount of changes, adjust the backup cycle or review the data backup policy to reduce the possibility of data loss.

- **_Total Net Output Bytes_**

  A widget that displays the amount of all network traffic sent by the database server to its clients. You can trace the activities of the server sending data to clients. This allows you to evaluate the server's response speed and the performance to handle client requests.

## Cluster Info widget

This widget provides the Redis cluster status and configuration data in a table format. You can see the overall health of the cluster of multiple instances at a glance.

The data for each column in the table is as follows:

- **_instance_**: Name or identifier of each instance in the cluster.

- **_cluster name_**: Name of the cluster to identify a cluster.

- **_flags_**: Flag indicating the status or characteristics of each instance.

- **_ip_**: IP address of each instance.

- **_link status_**: Connection status of each instance.

- **_slots_**: Slots used in the cluster. Each slot is a part of data in the cluster. This information helps you find the data distribution and load balancing status in the cluster.
