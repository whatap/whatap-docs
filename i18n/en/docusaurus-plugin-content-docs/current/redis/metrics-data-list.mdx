Database metrics comprehensively collect the database workload and resource usage. The WhaTap monitoring service continuously collects metric data to identify bottlenecks in the database and provides data to help identify the root cause of the performance issue.

For more information about other metrics, see [the following](https://redis.io/commands/info/).
