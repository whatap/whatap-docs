Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" />

In the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> dashboard, you can see the entire server information at a glance based on the columns set in the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu. However, when monitoring the server status and information, the criteria that each user considers important may differ. By reflecting this, <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides the feature to group the data based on user concerns.

For example, application managers focus on the status for server groups or individual servers that relate to a specific service, while infrastructure administrators are primarily interested in server hardware configuration information and resource utilization. The administrators may want to analyze the server status based on resource changes or key events over a specific period.

To accommodate various perspectives and needs, <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides the flexible grouping feature. This allows users to reorganize data according to their interests, allowing them to monitor and manage the server status more efficiently.

## Grouping & Card

<Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides cards by grouped server configuration information. When grouping is not applied, all server information is displayed within a single card. When applying grouping, cards are organized by each group unit.

When applying grouping, you can classify servers by sequentially selecting ***1st group*** and ***2nd group***. According to the primary and secondary grouping, ***1st group*** classifies data in card format, and ***2nd group*** presents each grouped data in subgroup format in the chart area within cards. 

- ***1st group***: The primary group displays data based on the **group category** and **group name**. 

  > e.g. <code class='custom-cl'>Infra_domain</code> **ALL**

- ***2nd group***: Secondary groups are displayed based on the **group name** and **number of servers in the group**.

  > e.g. **Finance (31)**

:::note 

If you hover over a server group or server, you can briefly check the major status of the group and server in a popover format.

## Key grouping properties

Based on <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" />, the default collection items and custom items among the columns that can be searched appear in the ***Grouping*** list. The default collection items are ***server type***, ***default group***, ***OS type***, ***OS version***, ***model***, and ***serial***.

Other items such as **infrastructure domain** (***Infra_Domain***) and **business major category** (***Biz_MainCategory***) that can be seen in the example image, are user-defined items added through the custom column (<code class='custom-cl'>custom</code>) in the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu.

You can further refine the view by **primary grouping** servers with the **infrastructure domain** based on physical or logical configuration, and then **secondary grouping** them based on **business-based major classification** for business purposes, through custom items. 

![Server inventory custom column example](/img/server-inventory-custom-cl-ex.png)

The example image displays the **infrastructure domains** in the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu sorted by the values ​​such as ***DB***, ***WAS***, ***WEB***, ***WEBWAS***, and ***ALL***, which includes custom infrastructure domains. Additionally, the **business-based major classification** items have been classified into values ​​such as ***External_System***, ***Processing_System***, and ***Finance***. 

Based on this information, you can configure the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> dashboard to monitor the overall operation status. 

## Metrics data by card

Below each card, a brief overview of key metrics information about the grouped servers is provided. For more information about each metric, see the following table. 

| Type               | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***CPU(%)***       | It displays the sum of the utilization in user mode (User) and kernel mode (Sys) out of the total CPU utilization.                 |
| ***Memory(%)***    | It displays the memory rate used by user processes and kernels, excluding the buffer and cache areas.                              |
| ***Swap(%)***      | It displays the size of the swap area in use as a percentage.                                                                      |
| ***Disk Busy(%)*** | It is the rate of the time processed for each disk per unit time, and displays the value for the most utilized disk on the server. |
| ***Network RX***   | It displays the amount of received (Rx) data in bps.                                                                               |
| ***Network TX***   | It displays the amount of transmitted (Tx) data in bps.                                                                            |

- ***Avg***: It displays the average metric value for all servers that belong to the group.

- ***Max***: It displays the maximum value of the metric.

- ***Max Server***: It displays the name of the server that recorded the maximum value.
