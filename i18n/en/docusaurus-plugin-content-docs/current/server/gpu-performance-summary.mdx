Home screen &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_serverList" className="uitext" /> &gt; **GPU Performance Summary**

Monitor and manage the status and performance metrics of GPUs connected to the system in real time. You can view both physical GPUs and MIG instances together, and efficiently sort or filter each item as needed.

:::note

**Supported Agent Version**

Only supported on Linux. Requires agent version 2.9.3 or higher.

:::

## **Basic Screen Overview**

Click ![Pause icon](/img/ic-pause-green.svg) <UI>Live</UI> to view or pause real-time data. You can search for GPU information using the search box.

Click on any column header in the data list to toggle between ascending and descending sort order.

* **Total**: Total number of GPU instances (including Physical + MIG)
* **Physical**: Number of actual physical GPU devices
* **MIG**: Number of MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) instances

### GPU Information

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Current status of the GPU instance (e.g., `Inactive`, `N/A`) |
| HostName | Hostname of the server to which the GPU is connected |
| GPU Index | Unique index of the physical GPU or MIG instance (MIG is shown in a format like `0/6/0`) |
| Model Name | GPU model name (e.g., NVIDIA A100-SXM4) |
| GPU Type | Type of the instance: either `Physical` or `MIG` |

### GPU Performance Metrics

| Column | Description |
| --------------- |------|
| GPU_Util (%) | GPU utilization rate (%)<br />- Displayed only for physical GPUs; MIG instances are excluded |
| Encoder_Util (%) | Hardware encoder utilization rate (%)<br />- Displayed only for physical GPUs |
| Decoder_Util (%) | Hardware decoder utilization rate (%)<br />- Displayed only for physical GPUs |
| GR_Engine_Active_Util (%) | Ratio of time the graphic or compute engine on the GPU was active<br />- Used to measure overall GPU utilization. In MIG environments, overhead between instances is reflected in physical GPU usage |
| SM_Active_Util (%) | Ratio of time at least one warp was executing in the SM<br />- GPU threads run in groups of 32 called warps, not individually |
| SM_Occupancy (%) | Ratio of active warps to the maximum number of warps that can run on an SM<br />- GPU threads run in groups of 32 called warps |
| Tensor_Core_Util (%) | Ratio of time the Tensor cores were active |
| Memory_Copy_Util (%) | Utilization of the GPU memory copy engine (%)<br />- Measures memory transfer activity between the GPU and host or within the GPU<br />- Displayed only for physical GPUs; not shown for MIG |
| DRAM_Active_Util (%) | DRAM read/write utilization<br />- Displayed only for physical GPUs; not shown for MIG |
| FP64_Compute_Util (%) | Active time ratio of the FP64 (64-bit floating point) execution pipeline |
| FP32_Compute_Util (%) | Active time ratio of the FP32 (32-bit floating point) execution pipeline |
| FP16_Compute_Util (%) | Active time ratio of the FP16 (16-bit floating point) execution pipeline |
| BAR1_Total_Memory (Bytes) | Total BAR1 memory<br />- BAR1 memory is used for data transfer between GPU and CPU |
| BAR1_Used_Memory (Bytes) | Amount of BAR1 memory currently in use<br />- BAR1 memory is used for data transfer between GPU and CPU |
| BAR1_Free_Memory (Bytes) | Remaining BAR1 memory<br />- BAR1 memory is used for data transfer between GPU and CPU |
| FB_Total_Memory (Bytes) | Total frame buffer memory size |
| FB_Free_Memory (Bytes) | Available frame buffer memory |
| FB_Used_Memory (Bytes) | Frame buffer memory currently in use |

| Power_Usage (W) | Current power usage by the GPU |
| Performance_State (P) | Current Performance State (P-State) of the GPU, represented as a number between 0 and 15<br />- P0 is the highest performance |
| Fan_Speed (%) | Current fan speed as a percentage |
| SM_Clock (MHz) | Current clock speed of the Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) |
| Memory_Clock (MHz) | Current memory clock speed |
| Video_Clock (MHz) | Clock speed for video processing |
| PCIE_TX (Bytes/s) | Amount of data transmitted by the GPU via the PCIe interface<br />- Displayed only for physical GPUs; shown as N/A for MIG |
