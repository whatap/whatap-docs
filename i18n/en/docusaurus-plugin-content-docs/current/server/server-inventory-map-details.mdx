- You can check the group data query time and refresh cycle through the **time selector** at the top, and you can stop or resume refreshing data. 

- In the left area, you can see the **server group cards** and **server list**.

- In each tab on the right, you can see the ***server inventory***, ***file system information***, and ***metrics information***. 

## Server group cards and list

Key summary information on the selected server group can be viewed through the server group cards and list. 

- If you hover the mouse over a server in the chart area within the server group card, a popover with summary information of the selected server appears. 

- You can specify a target server to query from the chart area and server list within the server group card. 

- When selecting a server from the server list, you can select all or deselect all. 

- When selecting a server, you can see the information of the selected server in individual tabs on the right.

## Server Inventory

You can check the detailed configuration of the selected server in list format in the <Cmdname sid="TTL08767" className="uitext" /> tab. If no server is selected, the server configuration information for all servers in the server group appears. The information and configuration that can be viewed in the <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu are the same. 

### Filtering

The <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" /> menu provides the server filtering feature based on the column list set in the menu.
