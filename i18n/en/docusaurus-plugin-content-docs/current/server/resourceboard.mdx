**_Resource Board_** allows you to monitor all servers registered in a project. 

It provides the **_CPU resource map_** to check the summary of all servers in the project and changes in real-time resource usage. It displays **_Top 5_** total resource size, CPU, memory, and utilization processes. You can immediately recognize and respond to failures through the **_resource board_**.

It provides the summary metrics for all servers registered in the project. They are updated every 10 seconds.

-   **Servers**\
      It provides the total number of servers together with the number of servers with problems. If you select an area, the **_Server List_** page appears.
    -   Exception status: <span class='vslow'>Danger</span>, <span class='slow'>Warning</span>
    -   Normal Server: <span class='snormal'>Medium</span>, <span class='k8s-normal'>Inactive</span>
-   **Total Cores**\
    Sum of cores for all servers.
-   **Avg CPU**\
      Average CPU usage (%) for all servers. The gauges below are Average, Maximum, and Minimum.
-   **Avg Memory**\
      Average memory usage (%) for all servers. The gauges below are Average, Maximum, and Minimum.
-   **Avg Disk**\
      Average disk usage (%) for all servers. The gauges below are Average, Maximum, and Minimum.
-   **OS**\
      Number of operating systems in the project such as Linux and Windows.

## ![](/img/number-03.png) CPU Resource Map

This distribution chart displays the CPU usage of all servers. It displays data for 10 minutes and is updated every 10 seconds. The deepness of the cell color indicates that the server's resource usage is widely distributed in the area.

-   **Provision of detailed info**\
      If you drag the cell area, the detailed information is provided.
      ![](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/Screenshot_2021-03-17_server_14861_-_Server_Monitoring18.png)
    -   The server list is sorted by the maximum value of the data collected in the range.
    -   Five servers are selected by default, and the usage trend of the selected servers are also provided in a multi-line chart.
    -   **_Click Refresh_** to refresh the current data. 

:::note

**Multi Line Chart**

Multiple lines are displayed on a chart.

## ![](/img/number-04.png) Resource Equalizer

It displays a list of the top 5 servers in real time for **_CPU_**, **_memory_**, **_disk I/O_**, and **_disk IOPS_**.

For example, the disk I/O (%) metric displays the disk usage for 5 seconds. If the disk I/O usage (%) exceeds 80%, the system performance can be affected. The default alert value is 90%. If the disk I/O (%) is 100%, it means that the disk is working non-stop.

-   If you select the equalizer chart area, the target **_Server Details_** page appears. 
-   If you select ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), the **_Resource Equalizer_** page appears. You can see the real-time usage for all servers.

## ![](/img/number-05.png) Process Top 5

The list of top 5 processes is provided based on the maximum occupancy of CPU and memory. If you select ![right-arrow](/img/right-arrow.svg), the **_process list_** for all servers appears.
