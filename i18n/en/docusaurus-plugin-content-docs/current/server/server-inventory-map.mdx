#### Grouping

{/* 1. 업무그룹 대 - 업무 그룹 중 (활용 예시)(나중에 12월?)
2. Infrastructure domain - Work group major (11 guidance method upon release) (English groups to be provided up to major level) */}

<Columns>

<Column className="text--left width--20">

<ImgLang img='server-inventory-map-group-select.png' desc='Server inventory map select grouping' />

</Column>

<Column className="text--left">

<Cmdname sid="side_serverInventoryMap" className="uitext" /> provides the ***grouping*** feature that can systematically classify the servers. Manage servers effectively by setting the grouping criteria depending on the monitoring purpose and environment.

Based on <Cmdname sid="side_serverInventory" className="uitext" />, the default collection items and custom items among the columns that can be searched appear in the ***Grouping*** list. The default collection items are ***server type***, ***default group***, ***OS type***, ***OS version***, ***model***, and ***serial***. Other items that can be seen in the example image are custom columns (<code class='custom-cl'>custom</code>) that are user-defined items.

You can classify servers by selecting ***1st group*** and ***2nd group*** sequentially. According to the primary and secondary grouping, in the ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) area, the ***primary group*** classifies the data in card format, and the ***secondary group*** represents each grouped data in subgroup format in the chart area within cards. 

</Column>

</Columns>

{/* 

Primary group: group, Secondary group: sub group, card

Cards are for group summary information, server group charts, and server group metrics information summaries. 

*/}

{/* 

Primary group - group, secondary group - sub group

You can classify servers by selecting ***1st group*** and ***2nd group*** sequentially. 

Panels are created in the grid area for each group. Secondary group is for group grid. 

When grouped, data is visually displayed in the group grid area of ​​the ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) chart. 2차 그룹은 

It displays servers grouped in detail within the primary group, represented as a list of servers distinguished by the chart and border.

### Group Info

In the <Cmdname sid="group_info" className="uitext" /> tab, you can effectively check the main operation status and resources of the selected server group as follows.

{/* 서버 업타임 */}

#### <Cmdname sid="TTL08660" className="uitext" />

It divides the operation period into sections since the server booting and visualizes the number of servers in the section in bar chart format. When a bar chart is selected, the detailed information of servers belonging to the section is highlighted in the <Cmdname sid="TTL08767" className="uitext" /> list below. If you click the same bar chart, the selection is released. 

{/* 

Displaying counts for each operation period section:

- The number of servers in the corresponding section is visualized in the bar chart format by dividing the sections based on the elapsed operation period since the server booting.

- Interaction feature:

- When you click on a bar chart, the details of the servers belonging to the corresponding section appear in the server configuration table below, with the selected items highlighted.

- If you click the same bar chart again, the selection is released.

This allows the administrators to intuitively check the server uptime distribution and easily check server information that belongs to a specific section. 

*/}

{/* 서버 인벤토리 */}

#### <Cmdname sid="TTL08767" className="uitext" />

You can see key information about the servers in the selected server group in list format. You can filter the data by entering the hostname or IP address in the input fields on the right.
