## Preliminary checking

To collect AWS logs, additional resources are required. WhaTap provides **WhatTap Forwarder** through the AWS Lambda function so that log information output from your AWS environment can be obtained and transmitted to the WhaTap collection server. Use AWS CloudFormation to run **Whatap Forwarder** in your AWS environment.

**WhatTap Forwarder** depends on the lifecycle of the AWS Lambda function. Concurrency constraints can be overcome through control factors. Adjust the following control factors depending on the number of logs of your environment.

- `ReservedConcurrency`: Number of concurrent executions
- `Timeout`: Retention time when there is no log inflow to the Lambda function
- `Memory`: Memory allocated to the Lambda function
- `ConnectionTimeout`: Timeout when sending logs to the WhaTap collection server

<details>
<summary>AWS resource logs supported by AWS Log</summary>

#### CloudWatch Log Group

- WAF
- API Gateway: The log group names must be set to **_api-gateway/gateway resource_** for collection.
- RDS
- DocumentDB
- REDIS
- EKS
- ECS

#### S3

- VPC: S3 bucket names must be set to **_VPC resource_** for collection of logs.
- CloudFront: While setting logs, the default prefix is **_cloudfront_**. This can be changed when setting parameters.
- ELB

## WhaTap Forwarder installation{#install-whatap-forwarder}

Install the **WhatTap Forwarder** for log transmission by using the AWS Lambda function. Proceed with the installation in AWS CloudFormation. Be sure to see the **_WhatTap Forwarder Installation_** tab in the WhaTap **_Agent Installation_** > **_Install guide_** section. The following installation inputs are required. 

- **AWS Region**

  Select an AWS region to install the Whatap Forwarder in. It must be the same as that of resources to collect.

- **CloudFormation Stack Name**

  Set the name of the CloudFormation Stack used to install or uninstall the Whatap Forwarder.

- **ConnectionTimeOut** <span class='type'>Second</span>

  Default `10`

  Set the timeout period (second) when the Whatap Forwarder connects the WhaTap collection server.

- **MemorySize** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1024`

  Set the memory allocation size (MB) of the Whatap Forwarder.

- **Timeout** <span class='type'>Second</span>

  Default `150`

  Set the idle period for the Whatap Forwarder in seconds. Specify the time before the Lambda function is removed when there is no log transmission request. 

- **UseReservedConcurrency** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to specify the maximum number of functions to be assigned to the Whatap Forwarder for stable transmission of logs.

- **ReservedConcurrency** <span class='type'>Second</span>

  Default `10`

  If the value of `UseReservedConcurrency` is `true`, specify the number of functions to be assigned to the WhaTap Forwarder. The number of assignable functions per AWS account is 1,000. The total number of functions that a user can use is limited to the value obtained by subtracting the `ReservedConcurrency` value from the total number of assignable functions per account (1,000000).

- **cloudfrontPrefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `cloudfront`

  It indicates the prefix value set when sending logs from CloudFront to S3.

### Installing the CloudFormation stack

<ImgLang img='aws-log-whatap-forwarder-install.png' desc='WhaTap Forwarder'/>

![WhaTap Forwarder create stack](/img/aws-log-create-stack.png)

1. In the ![number1](/img/number-01.png) **_WhaTap Forwarder installation_** tab of the **_Install guide_** section, select ![number2](/img/number-02.png) **_AWS Region_**.

## Creating the AWS IAM policy and role

The **_IAM policy_** and **_IAM role_** are required for the WhaTap Forwarder to receive logs from your AWS environment resources. If you have not created any IAM policy and IAM role for setting the Whatap Forwarder before, create new ones. 

### Creating the IAM policy{#create-iam-policy}

Specify whether or not to allow the access target resource. See the **_Create AWS IAM Policy_** tab in the WhaTap **_Agent Installation_** > **_Install guide_** section to proceed on. If any policy is missing, the setup does not work properly.

<ImgLang img='aws-log-create-policy.png' desc='IAM Policy Creation'/>

1. Log in to the AWS management console and open the IAM console. 

2. Select the **_Policy_** tab on the IAM console.

3. Select **_Create Policy_** and copy the following policy and paste it into the ![number1](/img/number-01.png) **_JSON_** tab.

   ```json title='IAM policy'
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "VisualEditor0",

                   "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                   "lambda:ListFunctions",
                   "logs:DescribeSubscriptionFilters",
                   "s3:GetBucketNotification"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {

               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::whatapforwarder",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::whatapforwarder/whatap.zip"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. Select ![number2](/img/number-02.png) **_Review Policy_** at the bottom.

- CloudWatch log subscription filter role
- Role to query the CloudWatch log group

:::

### Creating the IAM role{#create-iam-role}

## Starting the monitoring

<ImgLang img='aws-log-start.png' desc='Starting the AWS Log Monitoring'/>

After installation, go to **_Management_** > **_Log Setting_**. In the **_Start Log Monitoring_** section, select the **_Activate Log Monitoring_** toggle button to start monitoring AWS logs. 

- If you turn on the ![Icon](/img/ic-toggle-on.svg) toggle button, the log monitoring is enabled.
- If you turn off ![Icon](/img/ic-toggle-off.svg), the log monitoring is disabled. Logs are no longer saved.

If monitoring is enabled, you can check the output of incoming logs in **_Dashboard_** > **_Live Tail_**.

:::note

You can enable the log monitoring only when you have the **_Edit role_** on the project. For more information about roles, see [the following](../project/project-structure).
