## Preliminary checking

To collect AWS logs, additional resources are required. WhaTap provides **WhatTap Forwarder** through the AWS Lambda function so that log information output from your AWS environment can be obtained and transmitted to the WhaTap collection server. Use AWS CloudFormation to run **Whatap Forwarder** in your AWS environment.

**WhatTap Forwarder** depends on the lifecycle of the AWS Lambda function. Concurrency constraints can be overcome through control factors. Adjust the following control factors depending on the number of logs of your environment.

-   `ReservedConcurrency`: Number of concurrent executions
-   `Timeout`: Retention time when there is no log inflow to the Lambda function
-   `Memory`: Memory allocated to the Lambda function
-   `ConnectionTimeout`: Timeout when sending logs to the WhaTap collection server

<details>
<summary>AWS resource logs supported by AWS Log</summary>

#### CloudWatch Log Group

-   WAF
-   API Gateway: The log group names must be set to **_api-gateway/gateway resource_** for collection.
-   RDS
-   DocumentDB
-   REDIS
-   EKS
-   ECS

#### S3

-   VPC: S3 bucket names must be set to **_VPC resource_** for collection of logs.
-   CloudFront: While setting logs, the prefix must be set to **_cloudfront_** to enable collection of logs.
-   ELB

## WhaTap Forwarder installation{#install-whatap-forwarder}

Install the **WhatTap Forwarder** for log transmission by using the AWS Lambda function. Proceed with the installation in AWS CloudFormation. Be sure to see the **_WhatTap Forwarder Installation_** tab in the WhaTap **_Agent Installation_** > **_Install guide_** section. The following installation inputs are required. 

-   **AWS Region**

    Select an AWS region to install the Whatap Forwarder in. It must be the same as that of resources to collect.

-   **CloudFormation Stack Name**

    Set the name of the CloudFormation Stack used to install or uninstall the Whatap Forwarder.

-   **ConnectionTimeOut** <span class='type'>Second</span>

    Default `10`

    Set the timeout period (second) when the Whatap Forwarder connects the WhaTap collection server.

-   **MemorySize** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `1024`

    Set the memory allocation size (MB) of the Whatap Forwarder.

-   **Timeout** <span class='type'>Second</span>

    Default `150`

    Set the idle period for the Whatap Forwarder in seconds. Specify the time before the Lambda function is removed when there is no log transmission request. 

-   **UseReservedConcurrency** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    Set whether or not to specify the maximum number of functions to be assigned to the Whatap Forwarder for stable transmission of logs.

-   **ReservedConcurrency** <span class='type'>Second</span>

    Default `10`

    If the value of `UseReservedConcurrency` is `true`, specify the number of functions to be assigned to the WhaTap Forwarder. The number of assignable functions per AWS account is 1,000. The total number of functions that a user can use is limited to the value obtained by subtracting the `ReservedConcurrency` value from the total number of assignable functions per account (1,000000).

    <!-- You can use the function as many as (number of functions that can be allocated for each AWS account - `ReservedConcurrency` setting). -->

-   **cloudfrontPrefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `cloudfront`

    It indicates the prefix value set when sending logs from CloudFront to S3.
