:::note

This document guides you to additional settings required in the <span class='vpcbold'>VPC</span> environment to use **WhaTap Forwarder**. First install **WhaTap Forwarder**. For more information, see [the following](../aws-log/install-aws-log#install-whatap-forwarder).

:::

**WhaTap Forwarder** collects the AWS logs for AWS Cloudwatch LogGroup and S3. Use the AWS Lambda function for installation. AWS Lambda does not start from <span class='vpcbold'>VPC</span> (Virtual Private Cloud) by default. However, with the following additional settings, **WhaTap Forwarder** can be started in the <span class='vpcbold'>VPC</span> environment.

## Modifying the Lambda execution role

1. On the AWS Lambda Function console, select **WhaTap Forwarder**.

2. On the **\*Configuration** tab, select **_Execution role_** in **_Permissions_** to go to the AWS IAM console.

3. Go to **_Permissions policies_** under the IAM console's **_Permissions_** tab. 

4. Select **_forwarderpolicy_** in the policy list to go to the policy editing screen.

5. Select **_JSON_** tab and then copy and paste the following policy. The policy creates, defines, and deletes _ENI_.

```json title='IAM Policy'

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:{AWS REGION}:{AWS ACCOUNT ID}:log-group:/aws/lambda/*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*",
                "s3-object-lambda:Get*",
                "s3-object-lambda:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
                "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
                "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}

```

## VPC configuration

3. Seeing the following, set **_VPC_**, **_Subnets_**, and **_Security groups_**, and then select **_Save_** to save the results.

   ![Subnet and Security Group](/img/whatap-forwarder-vpc-sg.png)

   :::note

   **Subnets**

   - Access the Internet through **IGW** with **Public IP** of the **NAT Gateway**.

   - To connect the Internet via **IGW**, **Public IP** is required. _ENI_ of Lambda cannot allocate **Public IP**.

   - The request is not sent to **Private Subnet**, the Internet gateway. Accordingly, select a subnet on which outbound traffic is routed to **NAT Gateway**.

   - **WhatTap Forwarder** in **Private Subnet** and **Public Subnet**

   :::

   :::note

   **Security groups**

   - A security group with the **outbound** open is required.
