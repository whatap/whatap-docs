Resource logs generated on AWS are divided into the strings in log lines collected through CloudWatch Log and the logs stored in an archived form in S3. In general, you have to go through the cumbersome process of entering S3 and Log Group respectively and checking each resource as follows.

WhaTap AWS Log collects various logs that occur on AWS and provides functions for integrated monitoring. Using AWS Log, you do not have to go through the cumbersome steps above. WhaTap Forwarder subscribes to S3 and CloudWatch Log Group where AWS resource logs accumulate, and sends them to the WhaTap environment when logs are created.
