The **Network Insights** **Topology** view provides a visual representation of network devices and link structures.  

It not only shows the structure but also immediately reflects real time events such as link down, allowing administrators to quickly understand the network status.

Topology is available in two modes:

* **Monitoring mode**: view mode to check the entire network structure and monitor real time events  
* **Edit mode**: manage screen layout by creating areas or modifying node properties

## Default screen and settings

At the top of the topology screen, you can switch modes, select managers, change display formats, and access other main control functions.

### Main topology view

* Connections between devices are displayed as lines, with styles depending on status.

    * Normal: gray solid line  
    * Link down: red solid line  

* If a device is powered off or disabled, the icon color changes so you can check the status immediately.

* You can group devices by dividing areas with the custom grouping feature.

### Recent Trap Messages

The right panel displays trap messages collected in real time in sequence. You can check device and link events in **text log format**.

* Example: specific link down, device activation or deactivation
