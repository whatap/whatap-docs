WhaTap ***Network Management System*** is installed on a standalone virtual machine (VM). This allows the network management system to operate independently and reliably provide all the features for network monitoring and management.

## System requirements

The following are the recommended minimum specifications to ensure stable performance of the WhaTap ***Network Management System***. 

| Item       | Specifications                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **CPU**    | 4 Core or later (recommended)        |
| **Memory** | At least 8 GB                        |
| **Disk**   | At least 30 GB                       |
| **OS**     | Rocky Linux 9.4, Ubuntu Server 22.04 |

## Collection scope

WhaTap's ***Network Management System*** supports the following network data collection methods.

- **SNMP Polling** 

  It periodically requests and collects network equipment status and performance. The `SNMP v1` and `v2c` protocols are supported. 

- **SNMP Trap** 

  The events and notifications transmitted asynchronously from network devices are collected.

- **Syslog** 

  The log data generated from network devices is collected and analyzed in real time.

:::note 

Collection of network connection status and delay time (ping response time) via the **ICMP protocol** is scheduled for future development.
