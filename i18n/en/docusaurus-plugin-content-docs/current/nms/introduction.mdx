<<<<<<< HEAD
**Network Management System** (**NMS**) centrally and comprehensively monitors the status of network devices (routers, switches, servers, firewalls, wireless access points, etc.) to maintain the performance and stability. It helps you check the traffic, equipment status, bandwidth usage, and such across your network infrastructure in real time and quickly identify the cause when a failure occurs.

**NMS** focuses on fault prevention and problem detection, and plays an essential role in minimizing the network performance degradation and ensuring stable quality of the service (QoS). Operate your IT infrastructure efficiently and maintain business continuity with WhaTap **NMS**.
