<Cmdname sid="device_overview" className="uitext" /> is a dashboard composed of [Common options](#common-options) and [Widgets](#widget). It provides an at-a-glance view of the status and performance metrics of network devices in a project. Administrators can check key operational data such as interface status, traffic handling, ICMP HealthCheck, Syslog, Trap events, and real time logs in widget form.

## Common options {#common-options}

These features apply across the entire Overview screen and allow you to set the data query range, select managers, and save widget layouts.

* **Select preset**: load a saved widget layout and use it in the same arrangement

* **Save preset**: save the current screen configuration for later reuse

* **Widget management**: add, delete, rearrange, and resize widgets

    * **Delete widget**: right click on the widget you want to delete and click the `Delete` button

    * **Add widget**: right click on empty space and select the widget you want to add

## Widgets {#widget}

### Device status

Check the total number of interfaces and the number of active ones. When hovering over a device, status information is displayed. Clicking the device moves you to the interface detail screen.

* Example: `8 / 22` → 8 active out of 22 total

:::note
Interface information requires collecting SNMP ifTable (1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2) and ifXTable (1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1) data. Support may differ by device.

### ICMP HealthCheck

The ICMP HealthCheck widget displays network jitter and maximum round trip time (Max RTT) in a graph. If status is abnormal, the corresponding IP address is shown in <span class='vslow'>red</span>. Monitoring results are updated in 10 minute intervals.

1. Go to **Device inventory** and click the ![Edit icon](/img/ic-edit.svg) icon of the device you want to configure.

1. In the device settings screen, use the **Health Check** tab to configure.

### Today’s Syslog

Syslog events occurring today are displayed in a pie chart by severity level, categorized from Emergency to Debug. This allows you to intuitively check frequency and severity distribution.

### Top 10 devices by Trap events

Displays the devices with the highest number of Trap messages in the last 24 hours, sorted in descending order of event frequency. This helps quickly identify devices where events are concentrated.

### Maximum throughput interface

Displays the interface with the maximum throughput recorded in the last 24 hours, sorted in descending order by traffic volume.

* Example: `41.09 Mbps (FastEthernet8, 2025-08-27 16:50:36)`

### Maximum PPS interface

Displays the interface with the maximum PPS recorded in the last 24 hours.

* Example: `5.56K PPS (FastEthernet8, 2025-08-27 16:50:36)`

### Real time log events

Logs generated within the project are displayed in a real time table, showing time, host, and log details. New logs appear instantly in live tail format.
