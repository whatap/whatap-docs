In <Cmdname sid="side_oidManagement" className="uitext" />, you can register OIDs to be collected via SNMP polling. OID is an identifier for collecting various performance metrics of the network equipment.

## Basic screen

By default, OIDs are pre-registered in the system and can be added to collect dedicated metrics for specific devices. The added OIDs are used to connect to the device from the device management screen and collect data via SNMP polling.
