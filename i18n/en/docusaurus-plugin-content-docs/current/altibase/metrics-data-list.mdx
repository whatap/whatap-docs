Database metrics are a comprehensive collection of database workloads and resource usages. The WhaTap monitoring service continuously collects metrics to identify bottlenecks in the database and provides data to help identify the root causes of performance issues.

For more information about columns, see [the link](https://altibase.com/en/learn/manuals.php).
