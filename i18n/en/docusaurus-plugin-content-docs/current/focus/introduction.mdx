Focus is a program that uploads random data not provided by the WhaTap monitoring in time series. 

The operation team can upload the collected values by operating the self-developed check scripts or database queries periodically or once. Uploaded values can be viewed in the Analysis/Metrics Chart menu of the project. You can also add it to your Flex board.

To use Focus, select one of Server, Application (Java, PHP, NodeJS, Python), Database, and Kubernetes projects among WhaTap projects, and then specify the project access key string and collection server IP of the project as execution options.
