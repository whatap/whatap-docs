Logs are the files that have recorded the events and messages that occurred in applications and systems. It is important to check the logs to find anomalies for preventing system deterioration or detecting the failure causes. 

Modern IT service building environments are changing to MSA or Kubernetes. As a result, the targets to be managed are increasing. In typical log monitorings, the `tail` command or editor is used for checking after connecting the servers. However, in this case, it is difficult to use simple methods such as accessing individual servers one by one. How can you view the logs from hundreds or thousands of servers in severe cases? 

Through the WhaTap log monitoring service, you can easily manage numerous logs.

:::note

The Linux `tail` command is mainly used to check the logs whose content is added over time.

## Key features

- **Central integrated management**

  WhaTap can manage a large number of logs from the center. It is very convenient because you can check the log details without accessing individual servers. 

- **Collection of all logs**

  While collecting the logs selectively, important data may be missing. In general, WhaTap collects all logs. The collected logs can be checked in real time through the **_Live Tail_** menu.

- **Visibility**

  You can check the logs through various charts provided by WhaTab. Through this visibility, you can increase access to errors and issues and detect failures as soon as possible.

- **Flexible capacity management**

  While loading logs on individual servers, the logs may cause an excessive file system capacity being occupied. However, if the logs are collected through WhaTap, there is no need to maintain log files that occur on individual servers, and only the log maintenance period can be managed centrally. 

- **Various analysis perspectives**

  To find and predict failures, you have to analyze logs from various perspectives. WhaTap can check the log count trends with specific tags or the logs filtered by specific tags. For frequently used patterns, you can save them as charts so that you can search them at any time.

- **Pattern notification**

  Once you have found a pattern of failures, you can set this as an alert to recognize or prevent problems as soon as possible. WhaTap provides **_Real-time Log Alert_** to receive notifications when specific keywords are included on an individual log basis and **_Composite Log Alert_** to receive notifications based on the count trend of logs containing specific tags. 

## Analyzing logs

### Live Tail

Through **_Live Tail_**, the logs collected in real time can be viewed as they flow through the screen, just like using the `tail` command. For more information about **_Live Tail_**, see [the following](log-lt).

### Log Trend

Through **_Log Trend_**, you can see all the collected logs or the log count trend with specific tags. If the log counts are closely related to the times of failure occurrence and resolution, the failure cause analysis and response can be accelerated through the log occurrence trend. For more information about the **_log trend_**, see [the following](log-exp).

### Log Search

Through **_Log Search_**, you can view all the collected logs or the logs with specific tags. The logs generated in a specific time period or specific server can be viewed based on tags. The Adjacent Log function that checks the logs that occurred before and after a selected log, can be used to see the situation in which a specific error or exception occurred. For more information about **_Log Search_**, see [the following](log-search).

Logs are stored in files that record events and messages that occur during application execution. You have to look at the log files to understand the application behaviors and root cause of the issue occurred.

General log monitoring can be checked through the `tail` command or editor after accessing the server. However, it is difficult to use such a simple method in case of an MSA where many applications are distributed or a large number of logs are generated.

Through the WhaTap log monitoring service, you can easily manage or use various and numerous logs.

Integrating logs

You have to endure the inconvenience of accessing individual servers through a terminal to check logs displayed on the server. However, if you build the log integration system, you can check the content of logs centrally without accessing individual servers to ensure convenience. By checking the logs on the screen, you can early detect failures by increasing the accessibility to errors and issues. 

Especially in the MSA or Kubernetes environment that consists of multiple distributed applications, log integration can minimize the hassle of accessing individual servers or containers separately. That is why log integration is becoming essential.

Stacking logs on individual servers can excessively increase the file system capacity with the logs. It is required to take measures such as limiting the maximum load capacity so that it does not exceed a specific size. 

If logs are collected centrally, there is no need to keep log files on individual servers. Accordingly, you just need to manage the retention period of central log data.

Analyzing logs

The logs collected in real time can be viewed on the screen like using the `tail` command. 

For statistical purposes, you can classify logs to see the trend of log counts in specific intervals. If the number of logs occurred is closely related to the failure occurrence time and resolution, this can be checked through the log occurrence trend. 

By registering a log parser, you can quickly search a large number of logs with keywords under specific conditions and search the desired logs.
