**Permission**

Only users with log edit permissions can configure these settings.

:::

**Log Filter Settings** allow you to store only the logs that match the filter conditions specified by the user.  
By storing only the necessary logs, you can reduce costs. 

## Add a Log Filter Setting

This section explains how to add a new filter setting. When configuring log filter settings, **Filter Name, Show in Live Tail, Category, and Filter Condition** are required fields.

Even logs that are not stored by the filter can still be viewed in **Live Tail** if the **Show in Live Tail** toggle is enabled.  

:::caution

Only one filter can be set per category.

:::

1. Go to **Logs > Log Settings > Log Filter Settings** tab.

1. Click the **+ Add** button to create a new filter setting.

1. In **Add Log Filter Setting**, enter **Filter Name, Show in Live Tail, Category, and Filter Condition**.

    - **Filter Name**: A name to identify the filter.

    - **Show in Live Tail**: Select whether to display in Live Tail regardless of storage.

    - **Category**: The log category to which the filter is applied **(multiple selection allowed)**.

    - **Filter Condition**: Conditions for logs to be stored by the filter.
