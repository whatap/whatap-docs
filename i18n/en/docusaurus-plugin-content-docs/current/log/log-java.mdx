To collect logs from your Java application, complete the following 3 steps:

## Agent Update

It is available from Java agent 2.1.1. For more information about update, see [the following](../java/update-agent).

## Checking the agent settings

Home > Select Project > **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_**

Select a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_** under Project Menu. Proceed with the process according to the instructions in the **_Check Agent Settings_** tab of the **_Start Log Monitoring_** section.

1. Under Project Menu, select **_Management_** > **_Agent CONFIG._**.

2. In the **_Write Options_** tab, select **_Direct Input_**. Add the `logsink_enabled=true` option in the field.

3. Restart the application to apply the log monitoring.

### Key options

- **hooklog_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  It enables the log monitoring by hooking the log library.  

  :::caution

  Before running the application, this option must have been enabled in _whatap.conf_ to dynamically turn on or off the monitoring through the `logsink_enabled` setting.
  If the `logsink_enabled` option is set to `true` before running the application, log monitoring is possible without a separate setting.

  :::

  :::note

  If there is a possibility to use the log monitoring, it is recommended to set this option in advance.

  :::

- **hooklog_custom_methods**

  Register a user-defined log. An arbitrary log framework content is delivered. Use this to trace logs of the log module created on the website.

  ```java title='Java'
  package io.home.test;

  public class MyLog {  
    public void customLog(String log) { ... }
  }
  ```

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  hooklog_custom_methods=io.home.test.MyLog.customLog
  ```

- **logsink_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  It turns on or off Log Monitoring.

  :::caution

  Before running the application, if in _whatap.conf_, the `hooklog_enabled` option is set, this option can dynamically turn on or off the log monitoring.

  :::

- **logsink_trace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Set whether or not to expose the log tab of the transaction trace by inserting the transaction ID into the logs.  

## Enabling the log monitoring

Home > Select Project > **_Log_** > **_Log Setting_**

You can enable or disable the WhaTap log monitoring with the toggle button in the **_Activate log monitoring_** tab of the **_Starting the log monitoring_** section.
