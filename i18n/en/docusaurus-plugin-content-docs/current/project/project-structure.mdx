In the WhaTap monitoring service, you can easily manage multiple projects with the project hierarchy (grouping).

## Hierarchical structure

<ImgLang img='project-management-3depth.png' desc='프로젝트 계층 구조'/>

### What is the project?

The WhaTap monitoring project means a monitoring unit. In addition to being divided by project, the tenant roles can also be managed. A project is the most basic layer.

### What is the group?

Groups are helpful when managing multiple projects. Multiple projects make it cumbersome to manage. How can I add or grant roles to users for each project? In this case, you can group two projects into a group and manage users by the group. A single user can own multiple projects in a group.

Project users can inherit group users, and the users can monitor all projects in the group. A user who is granted the role only on the project can monitor only the project, regardless of whether the user is in a group or not.

### What is the organization?

An organization is a parent group to which groups can belong. In most situations, projects and groups are enough.

:::note 

**What customers can benefit from?**

In case of a business that specializes in the operations management service, multiple companies exist as a group. The number of groups and projects can be great. In this case, the group concept is not enough. We need one more concept to integrate groups for management. Use the organization concept.

A professional maintenance service company can group multiple subgroups into a single organization at a parent level. Grant each group member the corresponding roles. Members who have been granted roles can manage the group independently.

:::

## Member Role

If a parent group exists, the member roles of the parent group are inherited by default. For example, there are Organization A, Group B, and Project C. Without extra settings, Group B inherits Organization A's membership roles, and Project C inherits Group B's member roles.

:::note

Inheritance in programming is different from the general concept. For example, let's assume that User A inherits specific roles from User B. User A still has those roles.

## Member hierarchy scheme{#project-auth}

You can flexibly grant different roles to different members for each project or group. Below are basic descriptions of each role.

-   If you do not set the **Alert Reception** role, you can handle only the reception settings for your own account.

### Alert Config

In **_Alert_** > **_Notification Setting_**, the alerts can be added, deleted, or modified. You can also manage other functions.

### View Log

-   You can search the logs. This role is granted to members by default when inviting them to an organization, group, or project.

-   Only members with the **Log Read** role can access the log-related functions. The log-related functions are as follows.

:::note

Even if you have the **Log Edit** role, you cannot use the **_Log Setting_** menu when an **access key** has not been issued or the log monitoring is disabled.

:::

### Billing

-   Each organization, group, or project provides the **billing** role to only one person. There must be only 1 member with the billing role.

-   **_Billing_** appears next to the member with the **billing** role.

-   If A has transferred the **billing** role to B, A no longer has the right to make **billing**.

-   The member to whom the **billing** role is transferred must have registered the billing information. The billing information can be registered in **_My Usage_**. For more information, see [the following](../management/billing).

-   If there are billing staff for each organization, group, and project, the billing roles are granted in the order of project, group, and organization. If there is no billing staff for a group or project, billing is charged to the parent group or organization's staff with the billing role.
