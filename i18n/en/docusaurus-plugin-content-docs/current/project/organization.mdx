An organization is a parent group to which groups can belong. In most situations, projects and groups are enough. However, in case of a business that specializes in the operations management service, multiple companies exist as a group. The number of groups and projects can be great. In this case, the group concept is not enough. We need one more concept to integrate groups for management. Use the organization concept.

A professional maintenance service company can group multiple subgroups into a single organization at a parent level. Grant each group member the corresponding roles. Members who have been granted roles can manage the group independently.

## Create Organization

1.  Select the profile icon on the upper right of the screen. A drop-down menu appears.

2.  Select **_Create Organization_**.

3.  Enter values for **_Organization Name_**, **_Logo_**, and **_Description_**, and then select Next.

4.  Select a group to the organization in the group list, and then click **_Complete_**.

If the **_Created organization successfully._** message appears, the organization has been created successfully.

:::note

-   **_Organization Name_** is required. Even if you have not entered the **_logo_** and **_description_**, the organization can be created.
-   The group with the editing permission can be added to an organization.
-   If there is no editing permission, the group cannot be selected.
-   If you do not select a group, an organization can be created.
-   For more information about the roles, see [the following](../project/project-structure#project-auth).
-   If invited to the group without editing permission, it does not have editing permission for the group.
-   It cannot be deleted by the upper group or cannot be moved to another group.
