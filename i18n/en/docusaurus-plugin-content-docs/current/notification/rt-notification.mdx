You can see the alerts of all projects for which you have permission in real time and check their status at a glance. You can also see them classified by timeline, alert title, project, and application.

The interval to fetch the alert list in real time is 20 seconds. Select <Cmdname sid="refresh" className="uitext" /> on the upper right of the screen to newly update the list of alerts that occurred 20 seconds ago.

:::note

For more information on how to check for real-time notifications in individual projects, see [the following](../java/real-time-notification).

## Searching the alert

Enter the content to search in the text field on the upper left of the screen, and then select ![Search icon](/img/ico-search.svg). You can search the desired alerts. Searched results appear in the list at the bottom of the screen.

## Filtering by group, project, and product

You can filter the notification list by group, project, or product type. Select <Cmdname sid="project" className="uitext" /> on the upper left of the screen. If the <Cmdname sid="project" className="uitext" /> window appears on the right of the screen, select items by <Cmdname sid="group" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="project" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="productType" className="uitext" />.

<ImgLang img='rt-notification-filter.png' desc='Alert Filtering' />

- Selected items appear on the right of the alert search text field. You can select multiple items.

- To cancel the selection, select the items again.

- In the <Cmdname sid="project" className="uitext" /> window, select ![Close icon](/img/ico-close.svg) or click the outside of the <Cmdname sid="project" className="uitext" /> window. Then you can see the filtered notification list.

- In the <Cmdname sid="project" className="uitext" /> window, if there are too many items in the list, you can search the desired item through <Cmdname sid="search" className="uitext" />.

- You can also search the alert content with the items filtered.

## Setting the alert list time

You can check the lists of alerts for each time zone. Select the time selection box on the upper right of the screen, to the left of the <Cmdname sid="refresh" className="uitext" /> button. You can select any of <Cmdname sid="select_1_hour" className="uitext" /> (Default Value), <Cmdname sid="select_3_hour" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="select_6_hour" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="select_12_hour" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="select_1_day" className="uitext" />.

You can check alerts depending on the selected time zone through the timeline. It is easy to check the time zone for the most frequent alerts.

## Grouping the alert lists

<ImgLang img='rt-notification-grouping.png' desc='Alert Grouping' />

You can sort the notification list by <Cmdname sid="title" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="project" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="application" className="uitext" />. To ungroup it, select <Cmdname sid="timeline" className="uitext" />.

:::note

To turn on or off the sound when a notification occurs, select ![Sound icon](/img/ico-noti-sound.svg).

## Clearing the notification list in batch

From the real-time notification list, all event in progress can be cleared in batch.

1. Search or filter the alerts to clear so that they can appear in the list. 

2. Select <Cmdname sid="add_ack_to_project" className="uitext" /> on the upper right of the screen.

3. If the message window appears, select <Cmdname sid="DSC08323" className="uitext" />.

:::note

- It takes about 30 seconds to 1 minute to end the event resolution.

- The <Cmdname sid="add_ack_to_project" className="uitext" /> feature can generate a large number of clearing notifications for events in progress.

- Even after using the <Cmdname sid="add_ack_to_project" className="uitext" /> feature, if the event rule is enabled and the data exceeds the threshold, the event can occur again.

- The event clearing notification can be disabled through event modification in <Cmdname sid="side_event" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_eventSetting" className="uitext" />. Disable the <Cmdname sid="CNT08320" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="CNT08326" className="uitext" /> option.
