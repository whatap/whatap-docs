Let's learn about the commands that load metrics with the MXQL syntax.

| Command                       | Function                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [TAGLOAD](#tagload)           | It is used to search the data of the category that stores the collected data in the `tag-field` format. |
| [FLEXLOAD](#flexload)         | It is used to search the data of the category that stores the collected data in the `field` format.     |
| [LogSink](#logsink)           | Used to query raw log data.                                                                             |
| [LogSinkCount](#logsinkcount) | Used to aggregate log counts by time unit.                                                              |

## TAGLOAD{#tagload}

It is used to search the data of the category that stores the collected data in the `tag-field` format.

| Option                                            | Function                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{backward : true}`                               | Loads data in reverse chronological order.                                                      |
| `{filter : {key:fieldName, value :fieldValue}}`   | Extracts data where the value of the fieldName field is equal to fieldValue.                    |
| `{filter : {key:fieldName, exclude :fieldValue}}` | Data is extracted while excluding the data whose fieldName value is equal to fieldValue.        |
| `{filter : {key:fieldName, like :fieldValue}}`    | Extracts data where the value of the fieldName field has fieldValue as a substring.             |
| `{filter : {key:fieldName, notlike :fieldValue}}` | Data is extracted while excluding the data whose fieldName value has fieldValue as a substring. |

- In case no options are set

  ```sql
  CATEGORY app_counter
  TAGLOAD
  ```

- In case the backward option is set

  ```sql
  CATEGORY app_counter
  TAGLOAD {backward : true}
  ```

- In case the value filter is set

  ```sql
  CATEGORY app_counter
  TAGLOAD {filter : {key:pid, value:905}}
  ```

- In case the exclude filter is set

  ```sql
  CATEGORY app_counter
  TAGLOAD {filter : {key:pid, exclude:905}}
  ```

- In case of setting the like filter

  ```sql
  CATEGORY app_counter
  TAGLOAD {filter : {key:okindName, like:keeper}}
  ```

- In case of setting the notlike filter

  ```sql
  CATEGORY app_counter
  TAGLOAD {filter : {key:okindName, notlike:keeper}}
  ```

- In case of setting multiple filters

  ```sql
  CATEGORY app_counter
  TAGLOAD { filter:[{key:'host_ip', exclude:'192.168.1.102'}, {key:'container', like:'gateway'}] }
  ```

:::caution

- `TAGLOAD` and `FLEXLOAD` have set values for `CATEGORY` that can be set respectively.
- When using the `filter-like` or `filter-notlike` option, if a number comes as a value, it must be enclosed in single quotation marks ('') or double quotation marks ("") for operation.
  ```sql
  CATEGORY app_counter
  TAGLOAD { filter:[{key:'host_ip', exclude:'192.168.1.102'},{key:okindName, like:"1"}] }
  ```

:::

## FLEXLOAD{#flexload}

It is used to search the data of the category that stores the collected data in the `field` format.

| Option              | Function                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `{backward : true}` | Loads data in reverse chronological order. |

Data is loaded depending on the information set in the data search condition step.

```sql
CATEGORY event_cache
FLEXLOAD {backward : true}
```

:::caution

Most categories are using `TAGLOAD`. `FLEXLOAD` is used only when using data of categories included in [the following](#flexload-items).

:::

### List of categories that need to use FLEXLOAD{#flexload-items}

- `agent_list` category

  ```sql
  CATEGORY agent_list
  FLEXLOAD
  SELECT
  ```

- `db_agent_list` category

  ```sql
  CATEGORY db_agent_list
  FLEXLOAD
  SELECT
  ```

- `agent_count` category

  ```sql
  CATEGORY agent_count
  FLEXLOAD
  SELECT
  ```

- `event_cache` category 

  ```sql
  CATEGORY event_cache
  FLEXLOAD
  SELECT
  ```

## LogSink {#logsink}

Used to query raw log data.

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogSink
```

### Log Filtering

Use **LogTag** to filter logs by specific conditions.

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogTag {key:city, value:"junju"}
LogTag {key:status, value:"200", exclude:true}
LogSink
```

#### LogTag Parameters

* **key**: Index key to search
* **value**: Value to search (wildcards supported)
* **exclude**: Whether to exclude from search (true/false)

#### Important Notes

* LogTag must be written before LogSink or LogSinkCount
* LogTag can be specified multiple times for the same key or different keys
* LogTag should be added per search keyword

### Example

Example of querying the count of logs containing specific keywords.

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogTag {key:content, value:"*DebugUtil*", exclude:false}
LogTag {key:content, value:"*HttpServletRequest*", exclude:true}
LogSink
SELECT
GROUP {timeunit:1d, pk:pcode, merge:[rows]}
RENAME {src:_rows_, dst:rows}
CREATE {key:_pk_, value:pcode}
UPDATE {key:rows, value:sum}
```

#### Query Explanation

* First LogTag: Search for logs with "DebugUtil" in the content field
* Second LogTag: Exclude logs with "HttpServletRequest" in the content field
* GROUP with timeunit:1d aggregates by day
* merge:[rows] converts log count to MetricValue type
* UPDATE with sum calculates daily total count

---

## LogSinkCount {#logsinkcount}

Used to aggregate log counts by time unit.

### Basic Usage

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogSinkCount
```

Log counts are aggregated by time period (e.g., 1949, 1625, 1674... counts).

### Group Aggregation

You can aggregate logs by grouping based on specific fields.

#### Single Field Grouping

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogSinkCount {group:oname}
```

#### Multiple Field Grouping

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogSinkCount {group:"oname,oid"}
```

You can specify multiple fields separated by commas.

### Hourly Group Aggregation

You can perform aggregation operations on numeric fields.

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogSinkCount {group:oname, aggr:price.n}
```

:::note

Fields that can be stored in Aggr are limited to numeric (n) fields.

:::

#### Multiple Field Aggregation

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogSinkCount {group:oname, aggr:"price.n,age.n"}
```

Multiple fields can be entered in aggr separated by commas, but calculations are performed separately for each.

### Using with LogTag

You can aggregate only logs that meet specific conditions using LogTag.

```sql
CATEGORY AppLog
LogTag {key:level, value:"ERROR"}
LogSinkCount {group:oname}
```

The above example filters only ERROR level logs and aggregates counts by oname.
