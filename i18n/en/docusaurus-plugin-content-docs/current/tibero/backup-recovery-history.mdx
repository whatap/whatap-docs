It provides the records for database backup and recovery operations on the Tibero. This helps you review the data protection and recovery strategy by checking its success or failure and detailed information.

- You can check the backup success status and backup size for each database, and review the adequacy of the backup interval.

- You can check that the recovery was successful and analyze the cause of error if the recovery failed.

- Review the storage locations of backup files to ensure proper management and accessibility of backup files.

- Analyze the continuity and recoverability of backup files, and review their security by checking whether the backups are password protected.
