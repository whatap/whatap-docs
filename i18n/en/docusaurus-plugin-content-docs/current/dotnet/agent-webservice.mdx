You can trace [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/whats-wcf) or Web services for the .NET application server.

## Configuration guide

The following are agent configuration options for tracing WCF and Web services.

- **webservice_method_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  If the value has been set to `true`, web services can be traced. 

  :::note

  To apply the set values, restart IIS.

  :::

- **webservice_method_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Enter the name of the method to be traced along with the namespace. Because web services cannot be directly traced, directly enter the method that has used the web services as a trace target.

  See the following example:

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  webservice_method_prefix=Test.Demo, WebServiceDemo.WebService.
  ```

  :::caution

  - The methods that meet the conditions are traced even if they do not use web services. This feature was intended for WCF and Web services, but can also be used for other purposes.

  - If you enter just the class to which the method belongs, all public methods within that class are to be traced.

  :::

  :::note

  To apply the set values, restart IIS.

  :::

- **webservice_method_prefix_realtime** <span class='type'>Boolean</span> [<code className="my">.NET Agent v2.3.6 or later</code>](../release-notes/dotnet/dotnet-2_3_6)

  Default `false`

  If you set the value to `true`, the target of `webservice_method_prefix` is processed in real time as the previous.

- **webservice_method_timeout** <span class='type'>Integer</span>

  Default `5000` (Millisecond, ms)

  If exception handling is not performed in the method to be monitored, it is impossible to know the time when the transaction will end. For such cases, the timeout of web service monitoring occurs by default after 5 seconds. You can adjust the timeout by changing this option value.

## Usage examples

### Modifying the agent configuration file

See the example for the agent configuration file (*whatap.conf*) for the WCF and Web service tracing.

```ini title="whatap.conf" showLineNumbers {10-12}
license=...
whatap.server.host=15.165.146.117
whatap.server.port=6600
app_process_name=w3wp.exe
tag_counter_enabled=true
perfcounter.enabled=true
app_name=...
OID=...

webservice_method_enabled=true
webservice_method_prefix=Whatap.Service.Controller, Whatap.DotNet.Examples.Service1
webservice_method_timeout=10000
```

- The start and end of a function can be handled as a transaction, if the call path of the method containing the namespace is one of the following:

  ```txt
  Whatap.Service.Controller, Whatap.DotNet.Examples.Service1
  ```

- Because the `webservice_method_timeout` option has been set to 10,000 (ms), transactions that take more than 10 seconds are automatically terminated.

### Example of WCF source code to be monitored

The following WCF source code example guides you to a case to be monitored.

```csharp {5,10,15,20} showLineNumbers
namespace Whatap.DotNet.Examples
{
    public class Service1 : IService1
    {
        public string GetData(int value)
        {
            ...
        }

        public CompositeType GetDataUsingDataContract(CompositeType composite)
        {
            ...
        }

        private string getFromDB()
        {
            ...
        }

        private string getFromHttp()
        {
            ...
        }
    }

    public class Service2 : IService1
    {
        ...
    }

    public class Service3 : IService1
    {
        public string IwantToSeeOnlyThis(int value)
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The `GetData()` method to be monitored belongs to the `Service1` class of the `Whatap.DotNet.Examples` namespace. Therefore, the call path for the method is:

```txt
Whatap.DotNet.Examples.Service1.GetData
```

This is treated as a transaction because it starts from the value (`Whatap.DotNet.Examples.Service1`) of the `webservice_method_prefix` specified in the agent configuration file (*whatap.conf*).

:::note

- The `GetDataUsingDataContract()` method is to be monitored because it is a public method.

- The `getFromDB()` and `getFromHttp()` methods are excluded from monitoring because they are private methods.
