It guides you to the function to collect additional data through agents.

## User's log tracing function

This function allows user to leave a log message directly in the trace history. To leave logs, proceed with the following step.

- Add a CS file to the project to log in and then write your code.

  ```csharp
  using System;

  namespace Whatap.UserLog
  {
      public static class Tracer
      {
          public static void Trace(string message)
          {
              // You don't have to write any code.
              // The code inside this method is ignored by the WhaTap agent and is not executed.
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- At the location to log, add code in `Tracer.Trace("Log string")` format.

  ```csharp
  public string UserFunction(int value)
  {
      Tracer.Trace($"started... {value}");
      ...
  }
  ```
