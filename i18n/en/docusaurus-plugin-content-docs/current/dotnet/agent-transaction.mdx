## Transaction Tracing

The following agent options allow you to trace the execution paths of each transaction for applications in detail.

- **trace_active_transaction_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `3000`

  In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of slow active transactions is included.

- **trace_active_transaction_very_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `8000`

  In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a very slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of very slow active transactions is included.

- **trace_active_transaction_lost_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `300000`

  Timeout waiting for a transaction to end. If a transaction does not end within 5 minutes, no further transaction data is collected. You can see `Lost Connection` in the transaction trace information.

- **prepend_app_pool_name** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  If the option value is set to `true`, the full name of the application appears before the URL of the transaction.

- **trace_db_command_methods** <span class='type'>String</span> <Status priority='1'>Deprecated</Status>

  Enter the name of the method to monitor in the `System.Data.Common.DbCommand` class. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter. To monitor all methods, apply as follows:

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  trace_db_command_methods=ExecuteReader, ExecuteReaderAsync, ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteNonQueryAsync, ExecuteScalar, ExecuteScalarAsync
  ```

- **expand_transaction_level** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  If the option value is set to `true`, SQL and HTTP calls that occur outside of transactions are treated as transactions and displayed in the hitmap.

- **expand_transaction_basetime** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1000`(1 second) / Min `100`(0.1 second)

  When the `expand_transaction_level` option is `true`, data is collected only when the response time is longer than the set time. The data is collected up to 100 cases per second.

## Exceptional handling {#exception}

The following options are used to manage and monitor exceptions that occur in applications. You can check the stability of applications by registering business exceptions and collecting related statistics. You can also set whether to ignore specific exceptions or treat them as errors if the HTTP status code is an error. Exception-handled items appear as normal transactions in the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" /> window.

- **transaction_status_error_enable** <span class='type'>Boolean</span> <ScrollToLink anchor='transaction_status_error_enable' />

  Default `true`

  If an HTTP status code that is not a normal response such as HTTP 401 or 403, is returned, set whether or not to handle it as an error.

- **status_ignore** <span class='type'>String</span> <ScrollToLink anchor='status_ignore' />

  You can set the HTTP status codes to ignore. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  # example
  status_ignore=408,500
  ```

  :::tip

  Ignore status error/Hitmap display level: Excludes the <span class="normal">INFO</span> (blue)/error statistics.

  :::

- **status_ignore_set** <span class='type'>String</span> <ScrollToLink anchor='status_ignore_set' />

  `whatap.error.STATUS_ERROR` is ignored. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  # example
  status_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout/{time}:408,/error:500
  ```

  :::tip

  Ignore status error set/Hitmap display level: Excludes the <span class="normal">INFO</span> (blue)/error statistics.

  :::

- **httpc_status_error_enable** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Set whether or not to collect when the HTTP status code is an error. It includes client error responses (`400` or higher) and server error responses (`500` or higher).

  :::note

  For more information about the HTTP status codes, see [the following](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

  :::

- **httpc_status_ignore** <span class='type'>String</span>

  If the HTTP status code is an error (`HTTPC_ERROR`), it can be ignored. When listing multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  :::tip

  Ignore HTTP status error code/Exclude error statistics

  :::

- **httpc_status_ignore_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

  `whatap.error.HTTPC_ERROR` is ignored. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  Set it as `httpc_status_ignore_set=/a/b/c:400,/a/ab/c:404`. In Statistics/Error Analysis, enter the value for `HTTPC_URL`.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  httpc_status_ignore_set=/a/b/c:400,/a/ab/c:404
  ```

## HTTP transaction tracing

The following agent options trace and record various data related to HTTP requests and responses. This allows you to closely monitor and analyze the HTTP transactions for applications. You can add parameter values ​​to the transaction names or exclude specific URLs or HTTP methods. You can also record transactions in detail, including HTTP headers and parameters.

- **profile_http_parameter_keys** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Only the parameters corresponding to the set key are recorded. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

- **profile_http_header_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  To record HTTP headers in the trace details, set it to `true`.

- **profile_http_parameter_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><ScrollToLink anchor='profile_http_parameter' />

  Default `false`

  To record HTTP parameters in the trace details, set this to `true`. Parameters can be viewed by entering a separate security key.

  :::note

  Set the security key to 6 digits in _'%PROGRAMFILES%'\WhaTap .NET\paramkey.txt_ of the WAS server. If *paramkey.txt* does not exist, it is automatically generated as a random value.

  :::

- **profile_http_parameter_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It is used to define the prefix of URL to record HTTP parameters in the trace details.

- **profile_http_body_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It is used to define the prefix of the target URL to record the HTTP body information in the trace history.

- **trace_ignore_url_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets URLs to exclude from transaction tracing. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  :::note

  The URLs registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.

  :::

- **trace_ignore_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the prefix of URLs to exclude from transaction collection. URLs matching the set prefix are not collected for transaction performance. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  :::note

  The URLs registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.

  :::

- **trace_ignore_url_suffix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the suffix of URLs to exclude from transaction collection. URLs matching the set suffix are not collected for transaction performance. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  :::note

  The URLs registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.

  :::

- **disabled_section_names** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the section names to exclude from monitoring. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as a delimiter. Restart the IIS service after applying this option.

  :::note

  The section names that can be selected are as follows:

  AspNetCoreMvc2, AspNetMvc, AspNetWebApi2, AspNetWebForm, DbCommand, IDbCommand, SqlCommand, OracleCommand, WebRequest, HttpMessageHandler, HttpClient, WebClient, ServiceStackRedis, StackExchangeRedis, StackExchangeRedis2, LINQ
