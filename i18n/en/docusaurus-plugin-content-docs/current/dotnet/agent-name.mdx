## Agent naming method

The default patterns used to identify the application server are as follows:

```ini title='Default pattern'
{type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{process}
```

To change the default pattern value, modify _whatap.conf_ as follows:

```ini title='whatap.conf'
object_name={type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{process}
```

:::note

-   The agent name takes effect after the **Whatap .NET** service has been restarted.

| `{ip0}`        | The first byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **10** in **10**.11.12.13)     |
| `{ip1}`        | The second byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **11** in 10.**11**.12.13)    |
| `{ip2}`        | The third byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **12** in 10.11.**12**.13)     |
| `{ip3}`        | The fourth byte of the IPv4 address is used. (e.g. **13** in 10.11.12.**13**)    |
| `{process}`    | Process name of the application server                                           |
| `{hostname}`   | Host name                                                                        |

## Setting the agent name{#agentname}

:::note

-   The agent name takes effect after the **Whatap .NET** service has been restarted.

:::

-   **object_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `{type}-{ip2}-{ip3}-{process}`

    It is an agent naming (ONAME) scheme to identify applications. An OID is created based on the ONAME.

-   **app_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

    It is a component used in the agent naming (ONAME) scheme to identify applications. It corresponds to the `{type}` among the `object_name` options.

-   **app_process_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

    It is a component used in the agent naming scheme to identify applications. It sets the target process to collect data of the application server such as CPU and heap memory by using application process names. The value corresponds to the `{process}` of the `object_name`.

-   **whatap.okind** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the group unit to which the agent belongs. By setting multiple agents together, the topology can be checked by the group name.
