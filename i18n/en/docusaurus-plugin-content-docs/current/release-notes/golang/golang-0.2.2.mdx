- <Status>Change</Status> Modified the agent configuration method.

  - The _whatap.conf_ files are now configured for each process.

  - The _whatap.conf_ file must have been created before running the process.

  - The previous _/usr/whatap/agent/whatap.conf_ file uses only the whatap-agent service.

  :::note

  - It is recognized as an agent for each process for data separation.

  - In the past, multiple processes were all recognized as an agent, and their data was integrated.

  :::

  :::tip

  For more information about **agent configuration**, see [the following](../../golang/install-agent#set-agent).

- <Status>Change</Status> For agent IPC communication, UDP has been changed to TCP.

  - The `net_udp_host` and `net_udp_port` options remained without change.

  - The added `net_ipc_host` and `net_ipc_port` options are available.

  By default, the IP of 127.0.0.1 and the port number of 6600 are used. For update, change the user application and the whatap-agent service configuration file. The changes are applied after restarting.

  1. The _whatap.conf_ file of the user application has been changed.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  # Change the host.
  net_ipc_host=127.0.0.1
  # Change the port.
  net_ipc_port=6601
  ```

  1. The _whatap.conf_ file of the whatap-agent service has been changed.

  ```bash
  vi /usr/whatap/agent/whatap.conf

  # Change the port. 
  net_ipc_port=6601
  ```

  1. Restart

  ```bash
  service whatap-agent restart
  ```

- <Status>Change</Status> The agent naming convention has been changed.

  - Previous: `{type}`-`{ip2}`-`{ip3}`-`{process}`

  - Now: `{type}`-`{ip2}`-`{ip3}`-`{cmd}`-`{cmd_full}`

  :::note

  - `{cmd}`: Process name. The value of the executable args[0].

  - `{cmd_full}`: All the lines of the commands are hashed. All of the executable args.

  - When using the same process and arguments, the agent name can be duplicated. The `app_name` option can be arbitrarily set in _whatap.conf_. For more information, see [the following](../../golang/install-agent#duplicate_appname). After configuration, be sure to restart the application.

  :::

- <Status>Change</Status> Modified the memory usage.

  The memory usage appears with the sum of `HeapInUse` and `StackInUse` in `runtime.MemStats`.
