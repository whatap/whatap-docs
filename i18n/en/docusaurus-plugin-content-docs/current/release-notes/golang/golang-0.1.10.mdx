## Beta - update

### Collecting SQL and HTTP calls not included in the web transactions

In case of web transactions in the past, SQL and HTTP calls were collected only when the context includes WhaTap data (`trace.Start()` call required) and the unique transaction ID (`Txid`) was granted. 

If there is no unique transaction ID, the collected data can be retrieved from only the statistical data.
