- <Status priority='0'>Fixed</Status> In IBM Java and Widows environments, modified not to call JMX.

  - It is recommended to set `oshi` or `sigar` for collecting performance metrics.

    - In Java 1.8 or later, it is recommended to set the `oshi`.

    ```bash
    # default: false
    oshi_enabled=true
    ```

    - For Java versions earlier than 1.8, it is recommended to set the `sigar`.

    ```bash
    # default: false
    sigar_enabled=true
    ```

- <Status priority='0'>Fixed</Status> Fixed the issue where log tracing does not occur intermittently (Java agent 2.2.58).
