## Change (update)

### Adding the weaving setting

The weaving setting has been added to track open source plug-ins. +

The weaving setting that has the same functionality as the existing weaving_reserved setting has been added. +

### Modification of collection monitoring

The existing method of hooking the collection class has been modified so that the collection class data can be retrieved indirectly through CollectionHolder.

The class that creates the collection to the collection_nonstatic_holders setting has been added so you can see it in the collection map menu.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
collection_nonstatic_holders=org.apache.catalina.session.ManagerBase
```

### Adding the number of errors upon database call to the real-time statistics

If an error occurs during database call, the setting has been added to add the number of errors in the real-time statistics.

### Adding the real-time logs to connect the HTTP and database

The real-time logs have been added for HTTP and DB connections.

### Display of oname specified in the agent log

Even when `oname` is specified using the `-D` option, the setting has been modified to display the agent name instead of the PID in the agent logs.

### Adding the JDBC URL extraction delimiter

Modified to truncate based on "?" and ";" when extracting JDBC URL. 

```
Added ";"
```

### Adding the automatic recognition function when using the log open source

When using the logback and log4j open sources, or log related open sources including the logging string, the function has been added to automatically disable the hooking option.

### Adding the logsink collection data

The data collected in logsink has been added.

According to the configuration, you can determine whether the transaction ID, login ID, and HTTP host data are to be collected.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
_logtag_enabled = false         # tag

### Adding the JMX pool setting

The default value of the JMX pool object has been modified. An option to determine whether or not to use the data source name of the JMX pool has been added. If the data source name is registered, the JNDI method is executed. If the name is not registered, the default URL method is executed.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
jmx_pool_dsname_enabled=false
jmx_pool_object="*:type=DataSource,class=*,name=*"
```

The setting has been added to display the thread name of the active stack.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
active_stack_thread_name_enabled=false
```

:::note

If the Yard version is low and the value is set to true, the agent connection is disconnected continually due to a protocol error.

:::

### Adding the setting to display the asynchronous thread name

Added the setting to display the thread ID and name of the asynchronous thread.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
debug_async_thread_enabled=false
```

### Saving the database call URL

Modified to save the database call URL.

### Deletion of the database call hash value

Deleted the database call hash value from an error text.

### Modification of the agent execution logo

The logo content has been modified while the Java agent is running.

```bash
The Best Observability in Java
```

### Modified the asynchronous HTTP call error notification message.

The notification message has been modified to display the status code when an asynchronous HTTP call error occurs.

### Modification of the license key option in the agent settings

Modified whatap.conf to use both license and accesskey options.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Same function
license=
accesskey=
```

### Modification of the Java agent meta option name

Modified the name of the Java agent meta tag option.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
agent_meta_tags_enabled=true
```

## New features

### Adding the exclusions for the agent environment variables

The function has been added to exclude from the search items when a specific key value is entered in the environment variable search function.

The delimiter is "," and the value is not case sensitive. It can be used in connection with the `agent_env_system_enabled` and `agent_env_jvm_enabled` settings.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
agent_env_system_enabled=false
agent_env_jvm_enabled=true

agent_env_ignore_keys=user.timezone,user.name,user.language
```

### Adding the linked service tracing function

The linked service status tracing function has been added so that the target IP or service connection status can be checked in liveTail of log monitoring.

You can enable the function by setting `logsink_rt_enabled` to `true`, which collects logs with the `#RemoteTrace` category.

-   In case of a normal response, the level is ok. In case of error, the level is error.

-   In case of a normal response, logs are recorded according to `logsink_rt_ok_interval`. The default value is 30 seconds.

-   In case of an error response, logs are recorded according to `logsink_rt_ok_interval`. The default value is 5 seconds.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
logsink_rt_enabled=false

logsink_rt_error_interval=5000
logsink_rt_ok_interval=30000
```

### Adding the external call error notification

The function has been added to receive a notification when an error occurs when calling HTTP or database or the response is slower than the specified time.

-   The function can be enabled by setting `exception_alert_enabled` to `true`.

-   Using the `exception_alert_stack_size` option, you can specify the error stack length to receive alert messages.

-   You can disable error notifications for the specified period by the `exception_alert_silent_time` option.

-   The notification messages include URL, `status_code`, `error_message`, and `error_stack`.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Default
# Whether the error notification is enabled
exception_alert_enabled=false

# Whether the transaction error notification is enabled
exception_alert_service_enabled=false

# Whether the error notification is enabled upon HTTP call
exception_alert_httpc_enabled=false

# Whether the error notification is enabled upon JDBC call
exception_alert_jdbc_enabled=false

# Length of the stack displayed in the error notification message
exception_alert_stack_size=50

# Period of disabling the error notification message = 5 minutes (30000ms)
exception_alert_silent_time=300000

# Status code to ignore in the transaction error notification
status_alert_ignore=403

# url:status_code combinations to ignore in the transaction error notification
status_alert_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout:408

# Status code ignored in the HTTP call error notification
httpc_status_alert_ignore=408,500

# url:status code combinations ignored in the HTTP call error notification
httpc_status_url_alert_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout:408
```

### Adjustment of error levels of transactions and HTTP calls

A function has been added to recognize the status of transactions or HTTP calls as normal. When the transaction or HTTP call status is set to info, the version function has been added so that errors not handled by Spring Framework's ExceptionHandler can be recognized as normal. If the condition is met, INFO appears at the ErrorLevel in the hitmap and the error statistics include it.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Default
transaction_status_mode=normal
httpc_status_mode=normal

# Ignoring errors
transaction_status_mode=info
httpc_status_mode=info

# Recognized as status code info to ignore in the transaction error notification
status_alert_ignore=403

# url:status_code combinations to ignore in the transaction error notification are recognized as info
status_alert_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout:408

# Recognized as status code infor ignorec in the HTTP call error notification
httpc_status_alert_ignore=408,500

# url:status code combinations ignored in the HTTP call error notification are recognized as info
httpc_status_url_alert_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout:408
```

### Adding the Alibaba Druid connection pool tracing function

The function to trace the Alibaba Druid connection pool has been added.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
druid_pool_enabled=false
```

### Addition of the netstat function

Added the function to collect netstat by using the OSHI library. Among network metrics, the packet, collision, drop, error, and bps are collected.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
oshi_netstat_enabled=false
debug_oshi_netstat_enabled=false
```

The `TraceSQL.getResultSet` error of the batch agent has been corrected.
