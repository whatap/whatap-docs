-   <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the issue where any log occurs only in <UI>Log Search</UI> and the log does not occur in a transaction.

    If the following option is added in the _whatap.conf_ file, the log tracing is possible.

    ```ini title='whtap.conf'
    trace_logging_enabled=true
    ```
