- <Status priority='1'>New</Status> Added the tag count `kube_process` category.

  The tag count has been added to monitor Kubernetes-related processes running on the node. This allows you to trace processes running on a specific node and collect performance metrics.

  :::note

  - For more information about the related agent option (`collect_kube_node_process_metric_target_list`), see [the following](../../kubernetes/set-agent/#collect_kube_node_process_metric_target_list).

  - For more information about the process (`kube_process`) category, see [the following](../../kubernetes/metrics-kubernetes/#kube_process).

  :::

- <Status priority='1'>New</Status> Added the `kube_client_tls_verify` option into the **whatap-control-plane-helper** container.

  :::note

  If the option value is set to `false`, TLS authentication is not enforced and the authentication process can be skipped. For more information, see [the following](../../kubernetes/set-agent/#kube_client_tls_verify).

- <Status priority='1'>Feature</Status> Added the node status-specific count metrics to the tag count `kube_stat` category.

  Count metric has been added based on the node status in the cluster. It displays the number of nodes aggregated based on the Conditions(type:Ready) field of the node.

  - `ready_node`: Number of nodes whose status of **Ready** is set to `True`.

  - `not_ready_node`: Number of nodes whose status of **Ready** is set to `False`.

  - `unknown_node`: Number of nodes whose status of **Ready** is set to `Unknown`.

  :::note

  It is expressed in integer and monitors the node status in the cluster by aggregating the number of nodes for each status according to the node status.

  :::

- <Status priority='1'>Feature</Status> Added the count metric for each Pod status (Phase) into the tag count `kube_pod_stat` category.

  Count metrics have been added based on the Pod status (Phase) in the cluster. This allows you to quickly determine the status (phase) of the Pods running in the cluster.

  - `running_pod`: Number of Pods running in the current cluster.

  - `succeeded_pod`: Number of Pods that have been completed normally.

  - `failed_pod`: Number of failed Pods.

  - `pending_pod`: Number of Pods that are not yet running.

  - `unknown_pod`: Number of Pods whose status is unknown.

  :::note

  It is expressed in integer and monitors the Pod status in the cluster by aggregating the number of nodes for each status according to the Pod status (Phase).
