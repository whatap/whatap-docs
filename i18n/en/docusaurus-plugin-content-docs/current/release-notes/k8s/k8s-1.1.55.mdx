## Change of the worker node's disk capacity calculation unit into block

-   <Status>Change</Status> When calculating the disk capacity of the worker node, it is calculated from the capacity of total Bytes to the usage of Bytes. The symptom where less than 100% usage appears even when using 100% based on the block has been improved.

-   <Status>Change</Status> Block-based usage has been converted to Bytes for display, and the percentage display has been changed to blocks.
