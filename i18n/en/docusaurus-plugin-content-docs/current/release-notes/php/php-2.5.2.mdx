## Change (update)

### Log monitoring's compressed transmission; change to default settings

Set the default value of `whatap.logsink_zip_enabled` to `true`. Compressed transmission is the default. 

### Renaming the project license key to the access key

Among the agent options, `whatap.license` has been changed to `whatap.accesskey`. The existing `license` can also be used.

### Change in the TCP queue size

The size has been expanded from 256, 512 to 512, 1024. If there are a lot of log monitoring files set up, they are scaled up to handle the increase of TCP packets. 

## Fixed (bug fixing)

### Fixing the segmentation fault

Fixed the error where a segmentation fault occurred while using the `curl_setopt_array` function while the multi-transaction tracing option (`whatap.mtrace_enabled`) was enabled. 

### biz_exceptions option

Errors excluded by the `biz_exceptions` option are not marked as errors in the hitmap, but are applied only to the transaction profile and statistical data. We fixed the error that does not apply to the statistical data.
