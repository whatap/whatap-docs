:::note 

- For more information on how to add the ISAPI filter-based transaction tracing feature, see [the following](/dotnet/isapi-filter-based-tx-tracking.mdx). 

- You can use the ISAPI filter to trace transactions such as ASP Classic and PHP, running on IIS rather than .NET, and SQL. The HTTP call integration feature is currently in development.
