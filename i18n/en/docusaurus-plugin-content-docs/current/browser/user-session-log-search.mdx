End users can search using various conditions and identify the user session log by collecting the performance data, error data, and click data when interacting with the website. User session logs help analyze end user paths, identify reasons for user attrition, and analyze the performance and user experience.

Set the search time to view in the <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" /> option, and then select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png). You can set multiple search conditions consisting of keys and values in <Cmdname sid="filter" className="uitext" /> and then extract only the log data that matches the conditions. Log data is loaded by lines and displayed in a list. When you go to the bottom of the list, the following data is automatically retrieved for display.

## Guide to major search tags {#guide-search-tag}

### \#Category {#category}

The user session logs collected by the browser monitoring can be categorized as follows: Each **#Category** has a list of tags for searching by filters.

![Category](/img/browser-search-user-session-category.png)

- **_#BrowserError_**: Collects and provides source errors, network errors, and such that occur from the website.

- **_#PerformanceEvent_**: Collects and provides events that are related with page loading, AJAX, and router change.

- **_#UserEvent_**: Collects and provides user click events and custom events.

### User session log {#usersessionlog}

User session logs include the end-user environment and the data collected by **#Category**. If you select ![More icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg) on the utmost left, you can see the whole data that makes up the log.

![Log message](/img/browser-search-user-session-log-content.png)

The content of the first line consists of the end user's environment and **#Category**-based collection data as keys and values. Keys and values are used for search in <Cmdname sid="filter" className="uitext" />. The second line is the message of the user's session log.

![Key](/img/browser-search-user-session-tag.png)

The following are descriptions for major keys in the user session log.

- `PageUrl`: URL of the page where the event occurred.

- `userID`: ID of the user who generated the event. A unique ID that is issued by the browser agent when a user accesses a website for the first time. It has no expiration time. IDs are stored in browser cookies.

- `sessionID`: ID of the session that generated the event. A unique ID issued when a user starts navigation of the website. The maximum duration of a session is 4 hours, and the ID expires after 15 minutes of inactivity. IDs are stored in browser cookies.

- `type`: Type of the generated event.

  - **pageLoad**: Event that occurs upon loading the website.

  - **routeChange**: Event that occurs upon change in the route of the SPA website.

  - **ajax**: AJAX request-related event

  - **custom**: Custom event.

  - **browser_error**: Source errors, network errors, and the like in the website.

## Analyzing the user session {#analysisusersession}

In the viewed user session log list, select <Cmdname sid="analysis" className="uitext" /> in the <Cmdname sid="TTL07736" className="uitext" /> column. The <Cmdname sid="TTL07736" className="uitext" /> window appears where you can see the details of the user session log for the selected item.

Based on the user session, you can see the events and errors that occur while interacting with the website in chronological order. You can use the user session analysis as the following and enjoy better user experience.

- **On-page behavior analysis**: You can understand how the user navigates the website. It can analyze user activities on how you navigate, which pages you stay on, and which elements you click on. This helps you gain insight into how users use the website and understand the user behavior patterns by analyzing user paths.

- **Error tracing**: You can trace all types of technical issues (Java script errors, network errors, etc.) that occur during user sessions. You can monitor and analyze user behaviors such as clicks and page movements to find causes of failures.

- **Finding the cause of customer attrition**: You can reduce the churn rate by tracing user attrition from a specific page or failures to complete specific tasks, analyze the causes, and improve the area.
