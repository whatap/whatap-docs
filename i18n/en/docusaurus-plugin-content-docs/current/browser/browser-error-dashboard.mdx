The **_Browser Error_** dashboard is used to monitor, visualize, and display the browser application errors in real time. Through the dashboard, you can quickly identify errors, find their causes, and fix them. It provides various data such as AJAX error counts for each page and error type and error counts for each browser and error message.

## Error count by page

<ImgLang img='browser-error-by-page.png' desc='Error count by pages' />

It displays the numbers of all errors on each page. Hover your mouse over the chart to see the number of errors in the page group with a tooltip. The horizontal bar chart is the sum of error counts per page during the lookup time, with only the top 8 errors displayed.

## Error count by error type

<ImgLang img='browser-error-by-types.png' desc='Error count by types' />

It displays the console and source errors. The horizontal bar chart is the sum of error counts per error type during the lookup time, with only the top 8 errors displayed.

## AJAX Error Count

<ImgLang img='browser-error-ajax-by-error.png' desc='AJAX error count' />

It displays the number of AJAX errors occurring in the browser applications by classifying them by the fetch or XHR type. The AJAX error indicates that the status code is 400 or higher or the request has been canceled because the request itself could not be executed.

## Error Count By Browser

<ImgLang img='browser-erorr-by-browsers.png' desc='Error count by browsers' />

It displays the error counts for each browser in a pie chart. You can easily figure out which errors your browser is experiencing most often. If a specific browser has more errors than other browsers, the developer can proceed with optimization for the browser.

## Error count by error message

<ImgLang img='browser-error-by-messages.png' desc='Error count by messages' />

It displays the messages for source and AJAX errors, excluding console errors. The horizontal bar chart is the sum of error counts per message during the lookup time, with only the top 8 errors displayed.

## Error message table

<ImgLang img='browser-error-table.png' desc='Error message table' />

It displays the error counts by error message and the error counts by browser in a table. You can find which browsers are causing most errors and use them to troubleshoot. It is also useful for identifying the root causes of errors. If a new error occurs, you can quickly respond by seeing this table.

### Checking the error message details

If you select an error message from the **_error message_** list, you can see the statistics details based on the error message.
