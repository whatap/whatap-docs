The **[Page Load](before-starting#load-page)** event occurs when an end user visiting your web applications has finished loading. **Page Load** events are provided in a hitmap chart, and the detailed information about each event can be viewed in timelines. This allows you to determine what prevents your web pages from loading. The following information is included.

-   Time details for each **page load** event section

-   Details of the loaded resources

-   Browser error data

## Checking the page load event list{#pageload-events-list}

You can analyze load events on a single page basis. It provides the hitmap and various metrics to analyze the page load performance.

Drag the chart area of the ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) **_Page Load Hitmap_** widget. The page load event list of the dragged area is fetched to ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) **_Page List_** at the bottom of the screen, and the events are classified by **[Page Group](before-starting#page-group)** and then fetched as ![Leader line 4](/img/number-04.png) **_Page Group List_** on the right of the screen. In ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) **_Page URL Search_**, the desired page list can be searched.

![Resource List](/img/rum-pageload-event-03.png)

We provide a timeline chart based on the start times for each resource so that you can identify which resources are loaded slowly. By seeing the file sizes of each resource, you can improve the performance impact. You can check the detailed time information through the **_Resource Detail_** window that appears when you click each resource.
