### ![](/img/number-01.png) Data collection sampling

The WhaTap browser agent collects data based on the user session. You can set the percentage of all sessions collected from 0 to 100.

### ![](/img/number-02.png) WhaTap browser agent script

The WhaTap browser agent is provided in the form of an inline script. Add the script code provided by the installation guide to the top in the `<head>` tag of any HTML page to monitor.

Select one of the following two methods to apply the agent.

- **_Async_** (Asynchronous Load): Loads the WhaTap browser agent asynchronously in your web application. 
  - It does not affect the load performance of your web application. 
  - There may be missing data such as AJAX or errors that occurred before loading the browser agent.
- **_Sync_** (Synchronous Load): Loads the WhaTap browser agent synchronously in your web application.
  - It is recommended if you want to collect all data when loading your web application. 
  - It may affect the load performance of your web application.

## Setting the WhaTap browser agent's options

It sets the options to apply to the WhaTap browser agent. The options can be set in the Config object of the installation script. You can set the project access keys, percentage of all user sessions, resource domains to exclude from collection, and such.

```json title='config example' showLineNumbers
config: {
  projectAccessKey: {Project Access Key},
  pcode: {pcode},
  sampleRate: 100,
  ignoreOrigins: [ 'https://ignore-site.com/' , '/^(https?://)([^/]*)(ignore-site.io)(/)(.*)/i' ],
}
```

- **_projectAccessKey_**: Project access key
- **pcode**: Project code.
- **sampleRate**: You can set the rate of user sessions that are collected.
- **ignoreOrigins**: You can add specific resource domains to be excluded from statistics collection in the form of an array of strings. You can also apply regular expressions.

:::note

The `projectAccessKey` and `pcode` values are recommended to import the script code in the installation guide for use.
