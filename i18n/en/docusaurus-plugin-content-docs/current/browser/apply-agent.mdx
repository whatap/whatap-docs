### ![](/img/number-01.png) Data collection sampling

The WhaTap browser agent collects data based on the user session. You can set the percentage of all sessions collected from 0 to 100.

### ![](/img/number-02.png) WhaTap browser agent script

The WhaTap browser agent is provided in the form of an inline script. Add the script code provided by the installation guide to the top in the `<head>` tag of any HTML page to monitor.

Select one of the following two methods to apply the agent.

- **_Async_** (Asynchronous Load): Loads the WhaTap browser agent asynchronously in your web application. 
  - It does not affect the load performance of your web application. 
  - There may be missing data such as AJAX or errors that occurred before loading the browser agent.
- **_Sync_** (Synchronous Load): Loads the WhaTap browser agent synchronously in your web application.
  - It is recommended if you want to collect all data when loading your web application. 
  - It may affect the load performance of your web application.

## Setting the WhaTap browser agent's options {#setting-agent}

It sets the options to apply to the WhaTap browser agent. The options can be set in the Config object of the installation script. You can set the project access keys, percentage of all user sessions, resource domains to exclude from collection, and such.

```javascript title='config example' showLineNumbers
config: {
  projectAccessKey: {projec_access_key},
  pcode: {pcode},
  sampleRate: 100,
  ignoreOrigins: [ 'https://ignore-site.com/' , '/^(https?://)([^/]*)(ignore-site.io)(/)(.*)/i' ],
  collectUserClick: false
}
```

- **_projectAccessKey_**: Project access key

- **pcode**: Project code.

- **sampleRate**: You can set the rate of user sessions that are collected.

- **ignoreOrigins**: You can add specific resource domains to be excluded from statistics collection in the form of an array of strings. You can also apply regular expressions.

- **collectUserClick**: Click events can be collected. The default value is `false`.

:::note

The `projectAccessKey` and `pcode` values are recommended to import the script code in the installation guide for use.

## Next steps

- **Collecting custom events**

  To identify the web service issues and improve user experience through browser monitoring, it provides an interface that allows developers and operators to additionally collect desired events that occur on web pages. For more information about custom events, see [the following](collect-custom-events).

- **Setting the actual user ID**

  In the browser monitoring, you can collect data by setting the user ID via the actual user's login ID or email address. You can check the user session performance and event information based on the actual login ID, and then check the browser's errors to identify problems. For more details, see [the following](set-real-user-id).

- **Configuring the session replay**

  <Cmdname sid="TTL08103" className="uitext" /> is a feature that allows to record and replay all events performed by users on the website. This feature allows you to reproduce user behaviors such as clicking, scrolling, typing, and page switching. This helps you understand exactly how users actually interact with the website. For more details, see [the following](session-replay).

- **Starting the monitoring**

  Go to [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io) and then start the browser monitoring. Select a created project and then go to <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_rumDashboard" className="uitext" />. You can see the monitoring status. For more information about <Cmdname sid="side_rumDashboard" className="uitext" />, see [the following](dashboard).
