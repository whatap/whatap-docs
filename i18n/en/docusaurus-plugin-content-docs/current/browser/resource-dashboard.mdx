Widget charts are created by reprocessing resource data loaded by end users while using the web application. **_Resource_** dashboard is a real-time statistical data dashboard composed of these widgets. The load time of resources is an important user experience metric for web applications. The faster the resources are loaded, the more end users perceive the page to be available. The load time for resources is less than **800 ms** that provides a better user experience. For more information about the resource load time, see [the following](https://web.dev/ttfb/#what-is-a-good-ttfb-score).
