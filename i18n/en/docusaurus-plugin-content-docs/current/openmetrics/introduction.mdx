> **A new approach to integrated monitoring**

**WhaTap** <Cmdname sid="openmetrics" className="uitext" /> is a solution that automatically collects Prometheus-based OpenMetrics metrics, enabling you to build an integrated monitoring environment easily without complex setup.  
It collects a wide range of metrics regardless of whether you are in a new cloud environment or an old server setup, and provides them at a glance through dashboards and charts.

### Automatic collection and simple configuration

* Start automatic collection by simply registering an [OpenMetrics endpoint](../openmetrics/install)  
* Supports both on-premises and SaaS environments

### Intuitive visualization and analysis

Collected metrics are presented as real-time charts, and operators can immediately check each instanceâ€™s HTTP request throughput. The graphs let you grasp traffic surge timing and per server load balancing status at a glance.

#### Key observation points

If you visualize request rate by error type, you can easily identify when specific errors, for example 404 and 500, concentrate. This enables error pattern analysis and real-time monitoring of traffic change and server performance, followed by rapid response.

### Alerts and stable operations support

* Condition-based alert policies  
* Real-time alerts when thresholds are exceeded  
* Early detection of failures and improved service stability

### Various use cases

* **Infrastructure operations**: Track CPU, memory, and network usage, and plan capacity  
* **Application monitoring**: Analyze API throughput, error rates, and response latency  
* **Database performance analysis**: Detect slow queries, connection pools, replication delays, and deadlocks

### Operational efficiency and scalability

WhaTap OpenMetrics is more than just a metrics collector; it is an integrated monitoring platform that improves operational efficiency.  
With proven scalability in global SaaS environments, it can reliably collect hundreds of thousands of metrics.

This helps shorten incident response times and improve service quality.
