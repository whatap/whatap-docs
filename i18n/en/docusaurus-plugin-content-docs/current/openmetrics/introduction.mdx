> **A new approach to integrated monitoring**

**WhaTap** <Cmdname sid="openmetrics" className="uitext" /> is a solution that automatically collects Prometheus-based OpenMetrics metrics, enabling you to build an integrated monitoring environment easily without complex setup.  
It collects a wide range of metrics regardless of whether you are in a new cloud environment or an old server setup, and provides them at a glance through dashboards and charts.

### Automatic collection and simple configuration

* Start automatic collection by simply registering an [OpenMetrics endpoint](../openmetrics/install)  
* Supports both on-premises and SaaS environments

### Intuitive visualization and analysis

The collected metrics are provided in real-time charts, allowing operators to immediately check key indicators.  
For example, the chart below shows the distribution of API server error codes, helping you intuitively understand error types and frequency during specific time periods.

By visualizing error trends by request type, you can easily identify when certain errors (e.g., 404, 500) were concentrated. You can also quickly analyze root causes and take action.

### Alerts and stable operations support

* Condition-based alert policies  
* Real-time alerts when thresholds are exceeded  
* Early detection of failures and improved service stability

### Various use cases

* **Infrastructure operations**: Track CPU, memory, and network usage, and plan capacity  
* **Application monitoring**: Analyze API throughput, error rates, and response latency  
* **Database performance analysis**: Detect slow queries, connection pools, replication delays, and deadlocks

### Operational efficiency and scalability

WhaTap OpenMetrics is more than just a metrics collector; it is an integrated monitoring platform that improves operational efficiency.  
With proven scalability in global SaaS environments, it can reliably collect hundreds of thousands of metrics.

This helps shorten incident response times and improve service quality.
