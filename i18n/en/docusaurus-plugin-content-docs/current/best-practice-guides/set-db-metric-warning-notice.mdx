The following explains how to configure a metrics alert for database projects. You can set alerts based on the key metrics relating the database performance and quickly recognize potential problems.

## Configuring the process alert

While running databases, their processes may terminate unexpectedly. When any process running on the database is terminated, an alert is sent to users to quickly respond to the problem. 

### XOS agent configuration

Before adding a metrics event, add the following options in the XOS agent configuration file (_xos.conf_). The following example shows how to set the **top** and **lock.sh** processes as monitoring targets. Multiple processes can be registered using comma (,) as the delimiter.

```ini title='xos.conf'
process=top,lock.sh
```

### Adding the metrics event

This example shows how to set to send an alert when any process monitoring target set in the XOS agent (_xos.conf_) is terminated.

1. Under the user database project, go to **_Alert_** > **_Event setting_**.

2. Select the **_Metrics_** tab.

3. Select **_+ Add Alert Policy_**.

4. If the **_Metrics event_** window appears, enter the **_event name_**.

5. In **_Category_**, select the **_db_process_check_** item.

6. In **_Level_**, select an alert level.

7. In **_Message_**, enter the alert message. You can apply any variables to messages by entering the tags or field keys. 

   (e.g. `${oname}`, `${count}`, `${process_name}`)

8. Enter desired values from the following cases into **_Event rule_**.

   - In case any of **top** and **lock.sh**processes is terminated: `process_name == 'top' || process_name == 'lock.sh'`

     <ImgLang img='best-p/db-add-metrics-event-category-process-sample-00.png' />

   - In case multiple processes are terminated among monitoring targets in the xos.conf file: `count >= 2`

     <ImgLang img='best-p/db-add-metrics-event-category-process-sample-01.png' />

   - In case multiple processes among the monitoring targets set in the xos.conf file are terminated or the lock.sh process is terminated: `process_name == 'lock.sh' || count >= 2`

     <ImgLang img='best-p/db-add-metrics-event-category-process-sample-02.png' />

9. After all entries are made, select **_Save_**.

:::note

- To send an alert when the event condition has been resolved, select the <Cmdname sid="CNT08320" className="uitext" /> option.

- Tags or field keys can be seen in **_Sitemap_** > **_Metrics search_**.

- For more information about the **Metrics alert** for database projects, see [the following](../postgresql/metric-warning-notice).
