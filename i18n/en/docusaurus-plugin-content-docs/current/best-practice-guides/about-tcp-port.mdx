The following describes the need of TCP port monitoring and explains how to activate the TCP port monitoring through the <Cmdname sid="side_eventSetting" className="uitext" /> menu. 

## TCP port monitoring

In IT infrastructure management, TCP port monitoring is one of the basic and important ways to check the status of running services. TCP ports are the main communication paths for applications and services on the network. Each service communicates through a specific TCP port, directly or indirectly indicating the availability and performance of each service. Like this way, the TCP port monitoring plays an important role in ensuring the stability of the system by monitoring in real time whether the service is running normally.

For example, if an HTTP port such as 80 or 443 used by a web server, is not responding, the web server may be down or its access may be blocked due to network issues. In this situation, the TCP port monitoring can quickly detect problems and send notifications, allowing the administrator to respond immediately.

The WhaTap's server monitoring agent checks the status of the monitored servers in real time and also monitors the TCP communication status between the server and other services. This helps prevent service interruptions, maximize the system availability, and maintain the business continuity.

## Activating an alert

:::note 

Click Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_event" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_eventSetting" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="server" className="uitext" /> tab and select the **+** <Cmdname sid="add_alert_setting" className="uitext" /> button.

### Default notifications

The WhaTap Server Monitoring provides the **default notification**. You can complete basic notification settings without any additional actions by simply enabling the server **Restart** and data **Not received** within the event template as follows:

- **Restart**: A notification is sent when the monitored server performs the system reboot.

- **Not received**: If data is not received from the monitoring agent for a set period of time due to server downtime or network issues, a notification is sent for the condition.

### Alerting the TCP port monitoring

After activating **Port** in the WhaTap server Monitoring event template, set the monitoring target endpoint and TCP port through the following script. 

<Tabs groupId='server-user-script'>
<TabItem value="lxs" label="Linux Shell">

```bash title=SH
#Specify the IP to be monitored in the following variable.
export TARGET_IP=127.0.0.1
#Specify the port to be monitored in the following variable.
export TARGET_PORT=80
echo "tcp.check.$TARGET_PORT=tcp://$TARGET_IP:$TARGET_PORT" |sudo tee -a /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wps" label="Windows Powershell">

```bash title=SH
#Specify the IP to be monitored in the following variable.
$TARGET_IP="127.0.0.1"
#Specify the port to be monitored in the following variable.
$TARGET_PORT="80"
Add-Content -Path "C:\Program Files\WhatapInfra\whatap.conf" -Value "tcp.check.$TARGET_PORT=tcp://$TARGET_IP:$TARGET_PORT"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Confirming activation

#### *whatap.conf*

If the setting is completed to `127.0.0.1` in the Linux environment, the following content is added to the *whatap.conf* file in the */usr/whatap/infra/conf* path. 

```ini title='whatap.conf'
license=xxxxxxxxxx
whatap.server.host=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
createdtime=xxxxxxxxxx
tcp.check.8080=tcp://127.0.0.1:8080
```

import TcpMulti from "../common-items/_server-tcp-port-multi.mdx";

<TcpMulti />

#### Metrics Search

Once setup is completed, the `server_tcpport` category is added to the **Analyze** &gt; **Metrics Search** menu. Metrics notifications can be used based on the value of the `isAlive` field in the category.

## WhaTap server monitoring and TCP port monitoring

By using the TCP port monitoring provided by WhaTap's server monitoring, you can effectively check the TCP status even in the environments where agents cannot be installed or private network areas where monitoring data cannot be directly transmitted to outside.

The WhaTap's server agent periodically checks the TCP status for the monitored servers and other endpoints within the server. Therefore, in the environments where network communication is possible, more comprehensive and wide-ranging monitoring can be performed through the agents. This feature thoroughly monitors server status and connection status in complex network environments, enabling rapid response upon a failure.

By enabling various features of the WhaTap server monitoring, you can quickly understand and respond to the network and server issues of the operating system. WhaTap can help you ensure business continuity and maximize the stability of the services.
