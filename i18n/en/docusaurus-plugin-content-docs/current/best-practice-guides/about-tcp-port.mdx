The following describes the need of TCP port monitoring and explains how to activate the TCP port monitoring through the <Cmdname sid="side_eventSetting" className="uitext" /> menu. 

## TCP port monitoring

In IT infrastructure management, TCP port monitoring is one of the basic and important ways to check the status of running services. TCP ports are the main communication paths for applications and services on the network. Each service communicates through a specific TCP port, directly or indirectly indicating the availability and performance of each service. Like this way, the TCP port monitoring plays an important role in ensuring the stability of the system by monitoring in real time whether the service is running normally.

For example, if an HTTP port such as 80 or 443 used by a web server, is not responding, the web server may be down or its access may be blocked due to network issues. In this situation, the TCP port monitoring can quickly detect problems and send notifications, allowing the administrator to respond immediately.

{/* 문제 발생 시 관리자가 즉각적으로 대응할 수 있도록 알림을 발송합니다. */}

The WhaTap's server monitoring agent checks the status of the monitored servers in real time and also monitors the TCP communication status between the server and other services. This helps prevent service interruptions, maximize the system availability, and maintain the business continuity.

TCP ports are the main communication paths for applications and services on the network, directly or indirectly indicating the running status of each service. Therefore, the TCP port monitoring plays an essential role in ensuring stable operation of the server and services.

The TCP port monitoring allows you to check in real time whether a specific service is running normally. For example, if the HTTP port (such as port 80 or 443) used by the web server is not responding, this may indicate a downtime of the web server or a network problem. In this situation, the TCP port monitoring can quickly detect problems and send notifications, allowing the administrator to respond immediately.

By using the WhaTap's server monitoring agent, you can check the status of the monitored servers in real time and also check in detail the TCP communication status between servers and the connection status to other services. This helps prevent service interruptions, maximize the system availability, and ensure the business continuity. */}

The TCP port monitoring allows you to check whether a specific service is running normally. For example, if the web server port is not responding, it indicates that the web server is down or there is a network problem. The TCP port monitoring can help you detect and respond to these issues quickly.

By using WhaTap's server monitoring agent, you can check the status of the servers being monitored as well as the TCP communication status with other services.  */}

## Activating an alert

:::note 

Click Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_event" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_eventSetting" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="server" className="uitext" /> tab and select the ***+*** <Cmdname sid="add_alert_setting" className="uitext" /> button.

### Default notifications

The WhaTap Server Monitoring provides the **default notification**. You can complete basic notification settings without any additional actions by simply enabling the server ***Restart*** and data ***Not received*** within the event template as follows:

- ***Restart***: A notification is sent when the monitored server performs the system reboot.

- ***Not received***: If data is not received from the monitoring agent for a set period of time due to server downtime or network issues, a notification is sent for the condition.

{/* 다음과 같이 알림 템플릿 내 ***재시작***과 ***미수신*** 항목 활성화만으로 추가적인 조작이 필요없이 기본 알림 설정이 완료됩니다.

First, let's look at the basic notifications of the servers being monitored.  */}

### Alerting the TCP port monitoring

After activating ***Port*** in the WhaTap server Monitoring event template, set the monitoring target endpoint and TCP port through the following script. 

<Tabs groupId='server-user-script'>
<TabItem value="lxs" label="Linux Shell">

```bash title=SH
#Specify the IP to be monitored in the following variable.
export TARGET_IP=127.0.0.1
#Specify the port to be monitored in the following variable.
export TARGET_PORT=80
echo "tcp.check.$TARGET_PORT=tcp://$TARGET_IP:$TARGET_PORT" |sudo tee -a /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wps" label="Windows Powershell">

```bash title=SH
#Specify the IP to be monitored in the following variable.
$TARGET_IP="127.0.0.1"
#Specify the port to be monitored in the following variable.
$TARGET_PORT="80"
Add-Content -Path "C:\Program Files\WhatapInfra\whatap.conf" -Value "tcp.check.$TARGET_PORT=tcp://$TARGET_IP:$TARGET_PORT"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Confirming activation

#### *whatap.conf*

If the setting is completed to `127.0.0.1` in the Linux environment, the following content is added to the *whatap.conf* file in the */usr/whatap/infra/conf* path. 

```ini title='whatap.conf'
license=xxxxxxxxxx
whatap.server.host=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
createdtime=xxxxxxxxxx
tcp.check.8080=tcp://127.0.0.1:8080
```

#### Metrics Search

Once setup is completed, the `server_tcpport` category is added to the ***Analyze*** &gt; ***Metrics Search*** menu. Metrics notifications can be used based on the value of the `isAlive` field in the category.

## WhaTap server monitoring and TCP port monitoring

By using the TCP port monitoring provided by WhaTap's server monitoring, you can effectively check the TCP status even in the environments where agents cannot be installed or private network areas where monitoring data cannot be directly transmitted to outside.

</p>

The WhaTap's server agent periodically checks the TCP status for the monitored servers and other endpoints within the server. Therefore, in the environments where network communication is possible, more comprehensive and wide-ranging monitoring can be performed through the agents. This feature thoroughly monitors server status and connection status in complex network environments, enabling rapid response upon a failure.

By enabling various features of the WhaTap server monitoring, you can quickly understand and respond to the network and server issues of the operating system. WhaTap can help you ensure business continuity and maximize the stability of the services.
