The <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> menu provides useful features for checking the application environment and managing its performance. <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> provides detailed information on frequently used main menus and usage examples as follows.

## Loaded Classes {#advanced-use-loaded-classes}

Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_loadedClasses" className="uitext" />

The <Cmdname sid="side_loadedClasses" className="uitext" /> menu provides detailed information about the structure and method signatures for the classes loaded into the application, and also provides the <Cmdname sid="redefine" className="uitext" /> feature to allow uninterrupted changes to class behaviors.

#### Redefine

<Cmdname sid="redefine" className="uitext" /> allows you to change the behaviors of classes loaded at runtime without stopping the application by calling the `redefineClasses` method of `Instrumentation`. It is useful if you need to make modifications or changes to the running service. For example, when setting an additional transaction start point and measure the response time by specifying a new service pattern, you can find the class in the <Cmdname sid="side_loadedClasses" className="uitext" /> list after changing the related WhaTap settings and then click the ![Edit icon](/img/ico-edit.svg) icon for <Cmdname sid="redefine" className="uitext" />.

#### Resources

You can view which file the class was physically loaded from through the <Cmdname sid="resource" className="uitext" /> column. Due to the multi-layered nature of Java applications, it is required to check information like <Cmdname sid="resource" className="uitext" />. In complex application environments, it is important to identify exactly which *jar* file a class was loaded from.

Unexpected behavior or bug may occur if a specific class was loaded from the unintended *jar* file. This can make debugging easier, especially in complex classpaths or multi-module environments, by allowing you to see exactly which path a module was loaded from. 

{/* 으로 클래스간 충돌 방지, 디버깅, 성능 최적화 등을 도울 수 있습니다.  */}

{/* \* **클래스 충돌 방지** 

  The same class can exist in multiple *jar* files with different versions of third-party libraries. You can prevent class conflicts by identifying duplicate classes, adjusting priorities, explicitly excluding conflicting *jar* files, or including specific files.  */}

  {/* 
  At this point, you can avoid class conflicts by checking which *jar* file the class has been loaded from. It prevents the same class from being loaded from multiple *jar* files. 
  If the same class exists in multiple *jar* files (e.g. loading different versions of third party libraries), you can avoid class conflicts by checking which *jar* file the class was loaded from.  */}

{/* \* **디버깅** 

  Unexpected behavior or bug may occur if a specific class was loaded from the unintended *jar* file. This can make debugging easier, especially in complex classpaths or multi-module environments, by allowing you to see exactly which path a module was loaded from.   */}

{/* \* **성능 최적화** 

  Class loading may cause the performance issues. After checking which *jar* files are overloading classes, you can optimize the loading time of the class by adjusting the class path so that the *jar* files containing frequently used classes can be loaded from appropriate locations.  */}

  {/*

## Thread List/Dump {#advanced-use-thread-list-dump}

Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" />

{/* 스레드 목록을 보고 하는 중요한 행위-> 스레드 cpu 누적 시간 보여줌 -> 시계열 정보 확인 가능하다는 얘기를 추가하기 */}

The <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" /> menu allows you to check a list of running threads and view individual snapshots and a full thread dump for those threads. <Cmdname sid="hitmap" className="uitext" /> is the core of transaction response time-oriented optimization, while <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" /> is the core element of CPU optimization, which plays an important role in optimizing the application performance, diagnosing problems, and maintaining stability.

Determining which threads are using a lot of CPU is important for identifying the cause of the bottleneck. In particular, you must be able to query the time series data to identify threads that have spikes in CPU usage during a specific period. In <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="thread_cpu_time" className="uitext" /> means the total accumulated time that the thread has occupied the CPU. Upon ***Refresh***, the difference between the current thread CPU time and the previous thread CPU time, <Cmdname sid="TTL08126" className="uitext" /> is provided, allowing you to identify the thread using the most CPU at the time of query. Click the <Cmdname sid="TTL08126" className="uitext" /> column to sort in descending order to see the thread with the highest growth. 

<ImgLang img='best-p/about-instance-thread-list-dump3.png' desc='Thread List/Dump delta value' />

After specifying a thread in this manner, you can check the thread snapshot to find frequently called or long-running methods. This allows early detection and response to abnormal signs, for stable management of the system.

{/* :::note 

The thread in the example may have tried to get elements from the `RequestQueue`, and an exception occurs, causing `wait` to be called. Use the snapshot information to determine what caused the wait state.

- Check the line 58 of the `RequestQueue.get` method to see under which conditions the `wait` is called. 

- Check the line 54 of the `ZipSendProxyThread.run` method to see under which situations the `RequestQueue.get` method is called.

#### Checking the threads with high CPU usage

A spike in application CPU usage could be due to various causes. We can categorize these issues into three types: in case the heap memory is full, in case there are lots of requests, and in case there is a logic problem.

At this time, the first thing to check is the heap memory that is easy to identify. If the heap memory is full, the JVM performs GC frequently, which may cause CPU usage to spike. In this case, you can easily check it through the <Cmdname sid="AA010" className="uitext" /> graph of <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />. If there are lots of requests actually where the applications process a large number of client requests, it results in high CPU usage. Each request is processed by creating a Java thread, causing the CPU to perform a lot of work. In this case, you can check through the TPS-related metrics in <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />.

If the application code contains inefficient algorithms or infinite loops, it may abnormally result in a high CPU usage. In this case, you can specify the thread with high CPU usage through the <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" /> menu and then check the thread dump to find the problematic code.

:::note 

Check <Cmdname sid="thread_cpu_time" className="uitext" /> → <Cmdname sid="refresh" className="uitext" /> → Sort the list by <Cmdname sid="TTL08126" className="uitext" /> → **Identify threads with high CPU usage**

{/* 이때 가장 먼저 확인하는 것은 식별이 용이한 힙 메모리입니다. If the heap memory is full, the JVM performs GC frequently, which may cause CPU usage to spike. ~~Especially when a full GC occurs, the application temporarily stops operation and the CPU usage increases significantly. For example, if the application has a memory leak where objects are not properly freed and are occupying memory, you may run out of heap memory, and at this time, the JVM repeatedly run GC to reclaim memory, which can cause the CPU usage to increase rapidly. ~~ In this case, you can easily check it through the <Cmdname sid="AA010" className="uitext" /> graph of <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />. 

If there are lots of requests actually where the applications process a large number of client requests, it results in high CPU usage. Each request is processed by creating a Java thread, causing the CPU to perform a lot of work. ~~An example is to be a large-scale discount event on a shopping mall site that results in a spike in web surfer traffic. When a large number of users visit a website, the server generates many threads to process a large number of HTTP requests, which significantly increases the CPU usage. ~~ In this case, you can see the situation through the TPS metrics in <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />.

The third is the case when the problem is caused by a wrong code logic. If the application code contains inefficient algorithms or infinite loops, it may abnormally result in a high CPU usage. In this case, you can specify the thread with high CPU usage through the <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" /> menu and then check the thread dump to find the problematic code. */}
