The <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> menu provides useful features for checking the application environment and managing its performance. <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> provides detailed information on frequently used main menus and usage examples as follows.

## Loaded Classes {#advanced-use-loaded-classes}

Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_loadedClasses" className="uitext" />

The <Cmdname sid="side_loadedClasses" className="uitext" /> menu provides detailed information about the structure and method signatures for the classes loaded into the application, and also provides the <Cmdname sid="redefine" className="uitext" /> feature to allow uninterrupted changes to class behaviors.

#### Redefine

<Cmdname sid="redefine" className="uitext" /> allows you to change the behaviors of classes loaded at runtime without stopping the application by calling the `redefineClasses` method of `Instrumentation`. It is useful if you need to make modifications or changes to the running service. For example, when setting an additional transaction start point and measure the response time by specifying a new service pattern, you can find the class in the <Cmdname sid="side_loadedClasses" className="uitext" /> list after changing the related WhaTap settings and then click the ![Edit icon](/img/ico-edit.svg) icon for <Cmdname sid="redefine" className="uitext" />.

#### Resources

You can view which file the class was physically loaded from through the <Cmdname sid="resource" className="uitext" /> column. Due to the multi-layered nature of Java applications, it is required to check information like <Cmdname sid="resource" className="uitext" />. In complex application environments, it is important to identify exactly which *jar* file a class was loaded from.

Unexpected behavior or bug may occur if a specific class was loaded from the unintended *jar* file. This can make debugging easier, especially in complex classpaths or multi-module environments, by allowing you to see exactly which path a module was loaded from. 

## Thread List/Dump {#advanced-use-thread-list-dump}

Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_agentsConfiguration" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" />

The <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" /> menu allows you to check a list of running threads and view individual snapshots and a full thread dump for those threads. <Cmdname sid="hitmap" className="uitext" /> is the core of transaction response time-oriented optimization, while <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" /> is the core element of CPU optimization, which plays an important role in optimizing the application performance, diagnosing problems, and maintaining stability.

Determining which threads are using a lot of CPU is important for identifying the cause of the bottleneck. In particular, you must be able to query the time series data to identify threads that have spikes in CPU usage during a specific period. In <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="thread_cpu_time" className="uitext" /> means the total accumulated time that the thread has occupied the CPU. Upon **Refresh**, the difference between the current thread CPU time and the previous thread CPU time, <Cmdname sid="TTL08126" className="uitext" /> is provided, allowing you to identify the thread using the most CPU at the time of query. Click the <Cmdname sid="TTL08126" className="uitext" /> column to sort in descending order to see the thread with the highest growth.

After specifying a thread in this manner, you can check the thread snapshot to find frequently called or long-running methods. This allows early detection and response to abnormal signs, for stable management of the system.

#### Checking the threads with high CPU usage

A spike in application CPU usage could be due to various causes. We can categorize these issues into three types: in case the heap memory is full, in case there are lots of requests, and in case there is a logic problem.

At this time, the first thing to check is the heap memory that is easy to identify. If the heap memory is full, the JVM performs GC frequently, which may cause CPU usage to spike. In this case, you can easily check it through the <Cmdname sid="AA010" className="uitext" /> graph of <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />. If there are lots of requests actually where the applications process a large number of client requests, it results in high CPU usage. Each request is processed by creating a Java thread, causing the CPU to perform a lot of work. In this case, you can check through the TPS-related metrics in <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />.

If the application code contains inefficient algorithms or infinite loops, it may abnormally result in a high CPU usage. In this case, you can specify the thread with high CPU usage through the <Cmdname sid="side_threadList" className="uitext" /> menu and then check the thread dump to find the problematic code.

:::note 

Check <Cmdname sid="thread_cpu_time" className="uitext" /> → <Cmdname sid="refresh" className="uitext" /> → Sort the list by <Cmdname sid="TTL08126" className="uitext" /> → **Identify threads with high CPU usage**
