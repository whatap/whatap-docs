It can control the Go agent function.

- **enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It enables all the functions.

- **accesskey** / **license** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the access key granted by the server when installing the agent. The access key includes the agent's project and the encryption key for secured communication.

- **stat_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It enables the function to trace the statistics. Statistical data such as transactions, SQL, HTTPCALL, UserAgent, and client IP collected in every 5 minutes are applicable.

- **realtime_user_thinktime_max** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the maximum call interval credited by the same user when measuring the number of real-time users.

- **time_sync_interval_ms** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

  Default `300000`

  Set the synchronization interval between the agents and the server. For no synchronization, set it to 0.

- **text_reset** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `0`

  The WhaTap agent does not transmit the text data once sent until the next day again because it is hashed. If you set a value that is different from the previous setting, it will be sent again.

  Transaction URLs and SQL strings correspond to text data.

- **use_env_first** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  The priority of agent configuration is that the _whatap.conf_ file is applied first, followed by environment variables. To give priority to environment variables, set the option value to `true`. Alternatively, you can set the environment variable as `WHATAP_USE_ENV_FIRST=true`.
