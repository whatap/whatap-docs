It can control the Go agent function.

-   **enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables all the functions.

-   **accesskey** / **license** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the access key granted by the server when installing the agent. The access key includes the agent's project and the encryption key for secured communication.

-   **stat_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables the function to trace the statistics. Statistical data such as transactions, SQL, HTTPCALL, UserAgent, and client IP collected in every 5 minutes are applicable.

-   **realtime_user_thinktime_max** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

    Default `300000`

    Set the maximum call interval credited by the same user when measuring the number of real-time users.

-   **time_sync_interval_ms** <span class='type'>Milliseconds</span>

    Default `300000`

    Set the synchronization interval between the agents and the server. For no synchronization, set it to 0.

-   **text_reset** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `0`

    The WhaTap agent does not transmit the text data once sent until the next day again because it is hashed. If you set a value that is different from the previous setting, it will be sent again.

    Transaction URLs and SQL strings correspond to text data.
