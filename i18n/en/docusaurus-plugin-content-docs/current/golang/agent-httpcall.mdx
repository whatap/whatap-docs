-   **trace_httpc_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables the function to parse and normalize HTTPC URLs for transactions.

-   **trace_httpc_normalize_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Define the HTTPC URL patterns to normalize. It deletes the path parameter after parsing the call URL patterns.

    :::note

    For example, if declared as `/a/{v}/b`, `a/123/b` is replaced by `a/{v}/b`. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter. A complement is required after arranging substitution patterns.
