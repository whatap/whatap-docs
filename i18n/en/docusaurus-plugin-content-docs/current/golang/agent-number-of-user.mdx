It collects the numbers of users connected to the Go web application server.

-   **trace_user_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    Set whether or not to aggregate real-time users. If you set the value to `true`, it traces users based on the IP address or cookies. 

-   **trace_user_using_ip** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    Set it when classifying real-time users by the IP address. This data can be found in Real Time User. If the value is `false`, users are identified based on the cookie name in the `trace_user_cookie_keys` option.

-   **trace_user_cookie_keys** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `empty`

    Use the value that corresponds to the cookie key as the user identification value. With comma (_,_) as the delimiter, multiple values can be set.

-   **trace_user_header_ticket** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    To identify users based on a specific value in the HTTP header, set the HTTP key to use. If the HTTP key cannot be found, users are identified based on the cookie.

    :::note

    This cannot be applied together with the `trace_user_using_ip` option. 

    :::

-   **trace_user_set_cookie** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    To identify users, the user identification values are set as `WHATAP` key names in cookies. Set it when the `trace_user_header_ticket` option has been set and the header key cannot be found. If the HTTP key cannot be found, users are identified based on the cookie. 

    :::note

    This cannot be applied together with the `trace_user_using_ip` option. 

    :::

-   **trace_http_client_ip_header_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `X-Forwarded-For`

    This function sets the client IP (remote IP) with a specific HTTP header value. In the proxy environment, the `X-Forwarded-For` header can be set with the client IP.

-   **trace_http_client_ip_header_key_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    If the value is `false`, the HTTP Header is ignored and the client IP is set as the remote IP value.
