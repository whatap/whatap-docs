In the config file (_telegraf.conf_) of Telegraf, enable the setting of _outputs.whatap_.

:::note

Telegraf plug-ins must be configured directly on the service.

:::

A config file containing the WhaTap plugin can be created as follows:

```bash title=SH
# telegraf --sample-config > telegraf.conf
```

### WhaTap project information

In [Home screen](https://service.whatap.io/), select a project and then set the project data. You can check it in the agent installation guide of the project to connect.

- **Project Access Key**: Project access key to identify the project

- **Project Code**: Numeric code to identify the project

- **Collection Server Info** (IP, Port): IP and port of the WhaTap collection server that delivers the collected data

### config setting (toml)

```toml title='/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf'
# # Configuration for WhaTap
[[outputs.whatap]]
#   ## You can create a project on the WhaTap site(https://www.whatap.io)
#   ## to get license, project code and server IP information.
#
#   ## WhaTap license. Required
license = "x2tggtnopk2t9-xxxxxxxxxx-aaaaaaaaaa"
#
#   ## WhaTap project code. Required
pcode = 118
#
#   ## WhaTap server IP. Required
#   # Put multiple IPs with / as delimiters. e.g. "1.1.1.1/2.2.2.2"

servers = ["tcp://1.2.3.4:6600", "tcp://5.6.7.8:6600"]

#   ## Connection timeout.
#   # timeout = "60s"
```

- `[[outputs.whatap]]` Delete the comment (#).

- Delete the comment (#) of `license`. Enter the access key of the project. It is a character type.

- Delete the comment (#) of `pcode`. Enter the project code. It is numeric.

- Delete the comment (#) of `servers`. Set the collection server data (IP, port). The protocol supports only TCP. Register as "tcp://ip:port" in text format. Register in array format. Separate with comma (,) and then register values in array format.

:::caution

To apply the settings, restart Telegraf.
