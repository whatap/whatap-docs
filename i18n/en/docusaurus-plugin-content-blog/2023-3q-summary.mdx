## `Common`

Notable new features and changes in the `Common` section of WhaTap Q3 2023 include the addition of **Edit Project Flexboard** role and improvements for convenience.

The **Edit Project Flexboard** role has been added, so you need this role to edit the ***Flex Board*** in the project. 

Other updates have been made to improve overall convenience. The <Cmdname sid="BTN06853" className="uitext" /> menu has been added to check WhaTap's service version and product list.

In addition, the **WhatsApp** notification configuration has been added in <Cmdname sid="side_eventNoti" className="uitext" /> and the time selection restriction method when generating daily reports in <Cmdname sid="side_integratedReport" className="uitext" /> has been changed. Previously, you could select an end time up to 23:59 of the previous day, but now you can select an end time up to 1 hour before the current time. 

The following overview guide helps you understand what's new and what's not in the Common section for the 3rd quarter in 2023, along with the released versions.

## `Applicatoin`

We are introducing notable new features and changes in the `Application` product suite in Q3 2023, including the reorganized ***Transaction analysis*** feature and improvements to the <Cmdname sid="side_transaction_map" className="uitext" /> screen. 

The ***Transaction analysis*** feature has been reorganized. Previously, the transaction list was loaded under <Cmdname sid="hitmap" className="uitext" />, but now, the ***Transaction analysis*** pop-up window appears when you drag <Cmdname sid="hitmap" className="uitext" />, making it easier to analyze and compare information details for each section. Additionally, an option has been added to directly view errors only in the transaction list filter.

<LinkImage img='release/release-note-tx-new-feature.png' desc='' className='noneborder' />

<Cmdname sid="side_transaction_map" className="uitext" /> has changed the map design to improve visibility, and the error cases are now displayed first when normal and error transactions overlap.
