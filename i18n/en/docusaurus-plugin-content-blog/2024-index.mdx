At the top of the content, you can easily see new features and major changes for that quarter in a table format. The services and agent guide layouts for each product are as follows:

New features and changes for the product are introduced selectively along with an overview of the released version of the product so that you can see the overall flow of the quarterly service (<code class='New'>New</code>, <code class='Feature'>Feature</code>, <code class='Changed'>Changed</code>) and agents (<code class='New'>New</code>, <code class='Feature'>Feature</code>, and <code class='Deprecated'>Deprecated</code>). If you click the released version's tag (<code class='changelog-service'><a href="../release-notes/service/service-2_0_x"><code class='changelog-service'>Service 2.0.0​</code></a></code>), its release notes for that version appears.
