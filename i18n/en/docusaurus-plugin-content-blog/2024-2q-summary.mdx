## `Application`

Notable new features in the `Application` section of WhaTap in Q2 2024 include the improvements of <Cmdname sid="side_transaction_map" className="uitext" /> and the feature to change the default preset of <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" />, following the previous quarter (Q1).

As part of improvements of <Cmdname sid="side_transaction_map" className="uitext" />, a new custom filtering feature has been provided that allows you to view only the selected items in the response time distribution chart. In the <Cmdname sid="custom" className="uitext" /> tab next to the ***TOP 30*** section, enter the desired value directly for a specific transaction, domain, or IP to search for, or select an item from the ***TOP 30*** list. The response time distribution of the selected items is filtered in real time on the chart.

You can change the default dashboard preset that can be viewed when you first enter the <Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" /> menu. It provides a more personalized user experience by setting the preferred dashboard configuration as the default preset. After modifying the widget selection and arrangement as desired, try using the <Cmdname sid="BTN08106" className="uitext" /> option in the preset selection box on the upper right of the dashboard. The dashboard designated as default is marked with the <code class='default-tag'>default</code> tag in the preset list.

## `Server`

Notable new features in the `Server` section of WhaTap Q2 2024 include improvements to the installation screen and the introduction to the **Unix** `Solaris` installation package. 

The installation process for server monitoring products has been improved to be more intuitive. Instead of the previous method of separating tabs for each OS, user can now select an OS first and then an individual installation page tailored to the OS appears. 

![Server monitoring install page sc](/img/changelog/changelog-24q2-server.png)

In this Q2, a new **Unix** `Solaris` **agent installation package** is to be provided. Solaris that has been developed by Sun Microsystems, is a high-performance Unix operating system known for its scalability on SPARC systems and the features such as ZFS file system and DTrace. WhaTap supports Oracle Solaris 11.2 or later. You can install it simply by downloading the package by using the `Solaris` installation package and then running it. WhaTap Server Monitoring allows you to manage and monitor the `Solaris` operating system more effectively.

{/* 서버 모니터링 상품 설치 시 사용자가 운영 체제를 먼저 선택하여 보다 직관적인 방식으로 설치 과정이 진행되도록 <Cmdname sid="agentInstall" className="uitext" /> 화면이 개선되었습니다. Instead of the previous OS-specific tab separating method, you can select an operating system and move to a separate installation page for the selected OS.  */}

The agent installation process has been simplified and its usability has been greatly improved with an easy generation of agent installation file by selecting desired options in the UI.  */}

Due to ongoing changes in Kubernetes products and emergence of various container runtimes, the agent installation process is also becoming more complex. Following the support for *Helm* chart installation in Q1, WhaTap provide a new Kubernetes <Cmdname sid="agentInstall" className="uitext" /> feature in Q2. Previously, after downloading the *YAML* file for installation, there were cases where the items needed to be modified additionally. But now, when you select key components or features in the Kubernetes environment and features to use, appropriate installation files are provided in the UI. This makes it much faster and easier to install agents.

## `Database`

WhaTap is now announcing notable new features and changes in the `Database` section in Q2 2024, including the launch of **Oracle** product <code class="my">V2</code> and the Beta launch of **Oracle Pro**. 

The WhaTap database product suite is transitioning to <code class="my">V2</code>. Following **Redis** and **MongoDB** in Q1, the **Oracle** <code class="my">V2</code> service has been launched in Q2. The Oracle <code class="my">V2</code> has changed the structure of the data transfer package and the UI has also been improved overall. 

![Oracle new quarter example](/img/changelog/changelog-24q2-db.png) 

The **Oracle Pro** **Beta** service has launched in preparation for the official release in Q3. **Oracle Pro** has applied the technologies to monitor the performance metrics by directly accessing the memory of the database server. It can monitor accurate performance information up to 20 times per second by reflecting the latest data, and can minimize the load on the system by directly accessing memory without using the disk I/O. This allows you to quickly and accurately analyze issues based on the precisely collected performance data, such as execution time for a specific query and status of the buffer cache.

## `Browser`

WhaTap introduces <Cmdname sid="TTL08103" className="uitext" /> as a notable new feature in the `Browser` section for Q2 2024. It may be difficult to accurately reproduce the failures with just the list of events. The <Cmdname sid="TTL08103" className="uitext" /> feature allows you to automatically record and play every event users perform on the website. 

The interactions can be analyzed between the website and users by accurately reproducing every event, such as user clicks, scrolls, inputs, and page transitions. This enables real user experiences, allowing you to quickly identify and resolve potential issues, and provides insights into how users use the website and which can help you optimize it.
