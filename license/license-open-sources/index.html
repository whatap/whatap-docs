of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:<p>Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1<ol>
<li>
<p>Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>to reproduce the Original Work in copies;</li>
<li>based upon the Original Work;</li>
<li>to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;</li>
<li>to perform the Original Work publicly; and</li>
<li>to display the Original Work publicly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section intentionally omitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.</p>

<p>U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p>The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.

<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>1. DEFINITIONS</strong><p>"Contribution" means:<p>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<p>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<p>i) changes to the Program, and<p>ii) additions to the Program;<p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<p>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<p>"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<p>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<p>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.<p><strong>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</strong><p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<p>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<p><strong>3. REQUIREMENTS</strong><p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<p>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<p>b) its license agreement:<p>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<p>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<p>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<p>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:<p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<p><strong>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</strong><p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<p><strong>5. NO WARRANTY</strong><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<p><strong>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</strong><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<p><strong>7. GENERAL</strong><p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<hr></section>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.<p>“Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<p>“Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<p>“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.<p>“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.<p>“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program.

The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).</p>

</ul><p><strong>3. REQUIREMENTS</strong><p>3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:<ul>

<p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.<p><strong>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</strong><p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<p><strong>5. NO WARRANTY</strong><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<p><strong>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</strong><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<p><strong>7. GENERAL</strong><p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.<p>Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.<p><strong>Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice</strong><p>“This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”<blockquote>
<p>Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.</p>
<p>If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.</p>

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</section>
<section class=remark-sectionize-h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id=preamble>Preamble<a href=#preamble class=hash-link aria-label="Preamble에 대한 직접 링크" title="Preamble에 대한 직접 링크">​</a></h4><p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</section>
<section class=remark-sectionize-h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id=terms-and-conditions-for-copying-distribution-and-modification>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<a href=#terms-and-conditions-for-copying-distribution-and-modification class=hash-link aria-label="TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION에 대한 직접 링크" title="TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION에 대한 직접 링크">​</a></h4><p><strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<p><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<p><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<p><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<p><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<p><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<p><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<p><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<p><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<p><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.<p><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<p><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<p><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<p><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<p><strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong><p><strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<p><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</section>

It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<blockquote>
<p>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.<br>
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author</p>
<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License<br>

of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br></p>
<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
GNU General Public License for more details.<br></p>
<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
along wi>th this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.<br></p>
</blockquote><p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<blockquote>
<p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details<br>
type 'show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome<br>
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' <br>
for details.</p>
</blockquote><p>The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<blockquote>
<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright<br>
interest in the program `Gnomovision'<br>
(which makes passes at compilers) written<br>
by James Hacker.<br></p>
<p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br>
Ty Coon, President of Vice<br></p>
</blockquote><p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the <a href=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">GNU Lesser General Public License</a> instead of this License.<hr></section>

Program Number: 5725-I43<p>Program Name: IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation - System Pattern V8.0<br>
Program Number: 5725-I43<p>As described in the International Program License Agreement (“IPLA”) and this License Information, IBM grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit (“PVU”), a Resource Value Unit (“RVU”), a Value Unit (“VU”), or other specified level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee’s use may also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program. Additional rights may be available to Licensee subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or supplementary terms. IBM reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.<p>Program’s specifications can be found in the collective Description and Technical Information sections of the Program’s Announcement Letters.<p><strong>Multi-Product Install Image</strong><p>The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program (and its Supporting Programs, if any) for which a valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of the other software included in the image unless Licensee has acquired separate entitlements for that other software.<p><strong>Supporting Programs</strong><p>The Program is licensed as a multi-product package and includes the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee’s use of the Principal Program under this Agreement and within the limits of the Proofs of Entitlement for the Program (unless broader rights are provided elsewhere in this License Information document). The phrase “to support Licensee’s use” would include only those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. Licensee is not authorized to transfer or remarket the Supporting Programs separate from the Principal Program. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee’s use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program’s terms. When Licensee’s right to use the Program expires or terminates, Licensee must discontinue use, destroy or promptly return all copies of the Supporting Programs to the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee downloaded the Supporting Programs, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee wishes to license the Supporting Programs for any use beyond the limits set forth above, please contact an IBM Sales Representative or the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program to obtain the appropriate license.<p>The following are Supporting Programs licensed with the Program:<ul>

IBM Separately Licensed Code is licensed to Licensee under the terms of the applicable third party license agreement(s) set forth in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s) that accompanies the Program. Notwithstanding any of the terms in the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM, the terms of such third party license agreement(s) governs Licensee’s use of all Separately Licensed Code unless otherwise noted below.<p>Future Program updates or fixes may contain additional Separately Licensed Code. Such additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed in another NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the Program update or fix. Licensee acknowledges that Licensee has read and agrees to the license agreements contained in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s). If Licensee does not agree to the terms of these third party license agreements, Licensee may not use the Separately Licensed Code.<p>For Programs acquired under the International Program License Agreement (“IPLA”) or International Program License Agreement for Non Warranted Program (“ILAN”) and Licensee is the original licensee of the Program, if Licensee does not agree with the third party license agreements, Licensee may return the Program in accordance with the terms of, and within the specified time frames stated in, the “Money-back Guarantee” section of the IPLA or ILAN IBM Agreement.<p>Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party license agreement, the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM: (a) IBM provides this Separately Licensed Code to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND; (b) IBM DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE; (c) IBM is not liable to Licensee, and will not defend, indemnify, or hold Licensee harmless for any claims arising from or related to the Separately Licensed Code; and (d) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits, with respect to the Separately Licensed Code.<p>Notwithstanding these exclusions, in Germany and Austria, IBM’s warranty and liability for the Separately Licensed Code is governed only by the respective terms applicable for Germany and Austria in IBM license agreements.<p>Note: IBM may provide limited support for some Separately Licensed Code. If such support is available, the details and any additional terms related to such support will be set forth in the License Information document.<p>The following are Separately Licensed Code:<ul>

</ul><p><strong>Benchmarking</strong><p>Licensee may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the Program or its subcomponents to any third party provided that Licensee (A) publicly discloses the complete methodology used in the benchmark test (for example, hardware and software setup, installation procedure and configuration files), (B) performs Licensee’s benchmark testing running the Program in its Specified Operating Environment using the latest applicable updates, patches and fixes available for the Program from IBM or third parties that provide IBM products (“Third Parties”), and (C) follows any and all performance tuning and “best practices” guidance available in the Program’s documentation and on IBM’s support web sites for the Program. If Licensee publishes the results of any benchmark tests for the Program, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement between Licensee and IBM or Third Parties, IBM and Third Parties will have the right to publish the results of benchmark tests with respect to Licensee’s products provided IBM or Third Parties complies with the requirements of (A), (B) and (C) above in its testing of Licensee’s products.<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances may Licensee publish the results of benchmark tests run on Oracle Outside In Technology without prior written permission.<p>The above benchmarking terms apply to the following Programs or subcomponents:<ul>
<li>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation V8.0</li>
<li>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation for iOS V8.0</li>
<li>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation - System Pattern V8.0</li>
</ul><p><strong>Source Components and Sample Materials</strong><p>The Program may include some components in source code form (“Source Components”) and other materials identified as Sample Materials. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only provided such use is within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement, provided however that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and “AS IS”, WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<p><strong>Application</strong><p>Application is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Application is a uniquely named software program that is separately installable on a computing device. Licensee must obtain sufficient Application entitlements to cover all Applications that incorporate any portion of, connect to, or are managed by the Program.<p><strong>Program-unique Terms</strong><p><strong>Supporting Programs Details</strong><p>IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Core<ul>

<li>Entitlement: Ratio 50 Thousand Monthly API Calls / 1 Application</li>
</ul><p>“Ratio n/m” means that Licensee receives some number (‘n’) entitlements for the Supporting Program for every specified number (‘m’) entitlements of the Principal Program as a whole. Unless otherwise specified, the number of entitlements for the Supporting Program is rounded up to a multiple of ‘n’. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for a Supporting Program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the Supporting Program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee’s installation of the Program on account of the installation of the Supporting Program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to the Principal Program, as well).<p>“Use by Principal Program” means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration.<p>“Monthly API Calls” is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. An API Call is the invocation of the Program via a programmable interface. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of API Calls in any calendar month.<p><strong>Mobile OS Platforms</strong><p>IBM has tested sample applications created with the mobile tools provided in the Program (“Mobile Tools”) to determine if they will execute properly on certain versions of mobile operating system platforms from Apple (iOS), RIM (Blackberry), Microsoft (Windows, Windows RT, Windows Phone), and Google (Android) (collectively “Mobile OS Platforms”), however, Mobile OS Platforms are provided by third parties, are not under IBM’s control and are subject to change without notice to IBM. As such, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, IBM does not warrant that any applications or other output created using the Mobile Tools will execute properly on, interoperate with or be compatible with any Mobile OS Platforms or mobile devices.<p>L/N: L-BVID-A7WLJ8<br>

<li>Definitions</li>
</ol><p>“Authorized Use” - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units (“MSUs”), Processor Value Units (“PVUs”), or other level of use specified by IBM.<p>“IBM” - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.<p>“License Information” (“LI”) - a document that provides information and any additional terms specific to a Program. The Program’s LI is available at <a href=http://www.ibm.com/software/sla target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">www.ibm.com/software/sla</a>. The LI can also be found in the Program’s directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.<p>“Program” - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).<p>“Proof of Entitlement” (“PoE”) - evidence of Licensee’s Authorized Use. The PoE is also evidence of Licensee’s eligibility for warranty, future update prices, if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not provide Licensee with a PoE, then IBM may accept as the PoE the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom Licensee obtained the Program, provided that it specifies the Program name and Authorized Use obtained.<p>“Warranty Period” - one year, starting on the date the original Licensee is granted the license.<ol>
<li>Agreement Structure</li>
</ol><p>This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any), the LI, and the PoE and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee’s use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.<ol>
<li>License Grant</li>
</ol><p>The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.<p>IBM grants Licensee a nonexclusive license to 1) use the Program up to the Authorized Use specified in the PoE, 2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use, and 3) make a backup copy, all provided that<p>a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;<p>b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;<p>c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program;<p>d. Licensee ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee’s behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;<p>e. Licensee does not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program’s components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; or 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; and<p>f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item “f,” a “Supporting Program” is a Program that is part of another IBM Program (“Principal Program”) and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program’s LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)<p>This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.<p>3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes, and Patches<p>3.1.1 Trade-ups<p>If the Program is replaced by a trade-up Program, the replaced Program’s license is promptly terminated.<p>3.1.2 Updates, Fixes, and Patches<p>When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.<p>3.2 Fixed Term Licenses<p>If IBM licenses the Program for a fixed term, Licensee’s license is terminated at the end of the fixed term, unless Licensee and IBM agree to renew it.<p>3.3 Term and Termination<p>This Agreement is effective until terminated.<p>IBM may terminate Licensee’s license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement.<p>If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee’s copies of the Program. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to both parties’ respective successors and assignees.<ol>
<li>Charges</li>
</ol><p>Charges are based on Authorized Use obtained, which is specified in the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.<p>If Licensee wishes to increase its Authorized Use, Licensee must notify IBM or an authorized IBM reseller in advance and pay any applicable charges.<ol>
<li>Taxes</li>
</ol><p>If any authority imposes on the Program a duty, tax, levy, or fee, excluding those based on IBM’s net income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount, as specified in an invoice, or supply exemption documentation. Licensee is responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty, tax, levy, or fee for the import into or the export, transfer, access, or use of the Program outside the country in which the original Licensee was granted the license, then Licensee agrees that it is responsible for, and will pay, any amount imposed.<ol>
<li>Money-back Guarantee</li>
</ol><p>If Licensee is dissatisfied with the Program for any reason and is the original Licensee, Licensee may terminate the license and obtain a refund of the amount Licensee paid for the Program, provided that Licensee returns the Program and PoE to the party from whom Licensee obtained it within 30 days of the date the PoE was issued to Licensee. If the license is for a fixed term that is subject to renewal, then Licensee may obtain a refund only if the Program and its PoE are returned within the first 30 days of the initial term. If Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.<ol>
<li>Program Transfer</li>
</ol><p>Licensee may transfer the Program and all of Licensee’s license rights and obligations to another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee is prohibited from transferring the Program to another party. Licensee may not transfer a portion of 1) the Program or 2) the Program’s Authorized Use. When Licensee transfers the Program, Licensee must also transfer a hard copy of this Agreement, including the LI and PoE. Immediately after the transfer, Licensee’s license terminates.<ol>
<li>Warranty and Exclusions</li>
</ol><p>8.1 Limited Warranty<p>IBM warrants that the Program, when used in its specified operating environment, will conform to its specifications. The Program’s specifications, and specified operating environment information, can be found in documentation accompanying the Program (such as a read-me file) or other information published by IBM (such as an announcement letter). Licensee agrees that such documentation and other Program content may be supplied only in the English language, unless otherwise required by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.<p>The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program, or that IBM will correct all Program defects. Licensee is responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program.<p>During the Warranty Period, IBM provides Licensee with access to IBM databases containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses at no additional charge. Consult the IBM Software Support Handbook for further information at <a href=http://www.ibm.com/software/support target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">www.ibm.com/software/support</a>.<p>If the Program does not function as warranted during the Warranty Period and the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, Licensee may return the Program and its PoE to the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom Licensee obtained it and receive a refund of the amount Licensee paid. After returning the Program, Licensee’s license terminates. If Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.<p>8.2 Exclusions<p>THESE WARRANTIES ARE LICENSEE’S EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.<p>THESE WARRANTIES GIVE LICENSEE SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. LICENSEE MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.<p>THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 8 (WARRANTY AND EXCLUSIONS) ARE PROVIDED SOLELY BY IBM. THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SUBSECTION 8.2 (EXCLUSIONS), HOWEVER, ALSO APPLY TO IBM’S SUPPLIERS OF THIRD PARTY CODE. THOSE SUPPLIERS PROVIDE SUCH CODE WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT NULLIFY IBM’S WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.<ol>
<li>Licensee Data and Databases</li>
</ol><p>To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee’s system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond IBM’s warranty obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.<p>Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.<ol>
<li>Limitation of Liability</li>
</ol><p>The limitations and exclusions in this Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.<p>10.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable<p>Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM’s part or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM’s entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual direct damages up to the charges (if the Program is subject to fixed term charges, up to twelve months’ charges) Licensee paid for the Program that is the subject of the claim.<p>This limit also applies to any of IBM’s Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.<p>10.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:<p>a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;<p>b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR<p>c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.<ol>
<li>Compliance Verification</li>
</ol><p>For purposes of this Section 11 (Compliance Verification), “IPLA Program Terms” means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (<a href=http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies</a>), including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.<p>The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 11 remain in effect during the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.<p>11.1 Verification Process<p>Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee’s use of all Programs is in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of IBM’s applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with IPLA Program Terms.<p>Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee’s compliance with IPLA Program Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to IPLA Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee’s business, and may be conducted on Licensee’s premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.<p>11.2 Resolution<p>IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.<ol>
<li>Third Party Notices</li>
</ol><p>The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code (“Third Party Notices”) are included for Licensee’s information only. These notices can be found in the Program’s NOTICES file(s). Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as “Modifiable Third Party Code,” IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee’s modifications to such third party code. IBM’s service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.<ol>
<li>General</li>
</ol><p>a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.<p>b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.<p>c. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.<p>d. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations, including U.S. embargo and sanctions regulations and prohibitions on export for certain end uses or to certain users.<p>e. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee’s business contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in furtherance of IBM’s business relationship with Licensee.<p>f. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.<p>g. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.<p>h. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.<p>i. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 10.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.<p>j. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program, other than as expressly warranted in Section 8 (Warranty and Exclusions) above; 2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve.<p>k. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called “IBM Business Partners”) to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to Licensee.<p>l. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee’s other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to Program licenses granted under this Agreement.<ol>
<li>Geographic Scope and Governing Law</li>
</ol><p>14.1 Governing Law<p>Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Licensee’s and IBM’s respective rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles.<p>The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.<p>14.2 Jurisdiction<p>All rights, duties, and obligations are subject to the courts of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license.<p>Part 2 - Country-unique Terms<p>For licenses granted in the countries specified below, the following terms replace or modify the referenced terms in Part 1.

<section class=remark-sectionize-h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id=preamble-1>Preamble<a href=#preamble-1 class=hash-link aria-label="Preamble에 대한 직접 링크" title="Preamble에 대한 직접 링크">​</a></h4><p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</section>
<section class=remark-sectionize-h4><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id=terms-and-conditions-for-copying-distribution-and-modification-1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<a href=#terms-and-conditions-for-copying-distribution-and-modification-1 class=hash-link aria-label="TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION에 대한 직접 링크" title="TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION에 대한 직접 링크">​</a></h4><p><strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)<p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>
<li><strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.</li>
</ul><p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<p><strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<p><strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<p><strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<p><strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.</li>
<li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.</li>
<li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</li>
</ul><p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<p><strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
</ul><p><strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<p><strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<p><strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<p><strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<p><strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<p><strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<p><strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong><p><strong>15.</strong> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<p><strong>16.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</section>

It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<blockquote>

</ol><p><strong>3. Distribution Obligations</strong><p>3.1. Application of License.<p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section <a href=#section-2.2>2.2</a>. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section <a href=#section-6.1>6.1</a>, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section <a href=#section-3.5>3.5</a>.<p>3.2. Availability of Source Code.<p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<p>3.3. Description of Modifications.<p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<p>(a) Third Party Claims<p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections <a href=#section-2.1>2.1</a> or <a href=#section-2.2>2.2</a>, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section <a href=#section-3.2>3.2</a>, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<p>(b) Contributor APIs<p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the <strong>legal</strong> file.<p>(c) Representations.<p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (<a href=#section-3.4-a>a</a>) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<p>3.5. Required Notices.<p>You must duplicate the notice in <a href=#exhibit-a>Exhibit A</a> in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <a href=#exhibit-a>Exhibit A</a>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections <a href=#section-3.1>3.1</a>, <a href=#section-3.2>3.2</a>, <a href=#section-3.3>3.3</a>, <a href=#section-3.4>3.4</a> and <a href=#section-3.5>3.5</a> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section <a href=#section-3.2>3.2</a>. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<p>3.7. Larger Works.<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<p><strong>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</strong><p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the <strong>legal</strong> file described in Section <a href=#section-3.4>3.4</a> and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<p><strong>5. Application of this License</strong><p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in <a href=#exhibit-a>Exhibit A</a> and to related Covered Code.<p><strong>6. Versions of the License</strong><p>6.1. New Versions<p>Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<p>6.2. Effect of New Versions<p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.<p>6.3. Derivative Works<p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in <a href=#exhibit-a>Exhibit A</a> shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<p><strong>7. Disclaimer of warranty</strong><p><strong>Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.</strong><p><strong>8. Termination</strong><p>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<p>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:<ol>
<li>such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections <a href=#section-2.1>2.1</a> and/or <a href=#section-2.2>2.2</a> of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections <a href=#section-2.1>2.1</a> and/or <a href=#section-2.2>2.2</a> automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.</li>
<li>any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(<a href=#section-2.1-b>b</a>) and 2.2(<a href=#section-2.2-b>b</a>) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.</li>
</ol><p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections <a href=#section-2.1>2.1</a> or <a href=#section-2.2>2.2</a> shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.<p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections <a href=#section-8.1>8.1</a> or <a href=#section-8.2>8.2</a> above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.<p><strong>9. Limitation of liability</strong><p><strong>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.</strong><p><strong>10. U.S. government end users</strong><p>The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<p><strong>11. Miscellaneous</strong><p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<p><strong>12. Responsibility for claims</strong><p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<p><strong>13. Multiple-licensed code</strong><p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in <a href=#exhibit-a>Exhibit A</a>.<p>Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License. <a href=/whatap-docs/license/license-open-sources##exhibit-a class=hash-link><span id=#exhibit-a>​</span></a><blockquote>

Here is the text:<p>The Universal FOSS Exception, Version 1.0<p>In addition to the rights set forth in the other license(s) included in the distribution for this software, data, and/or documentation (collectively the "Software," and such licenses collectively with this additional permission the "Software License"), the copyright holders wish to facilitate interoperability with other software, data, and/or documentation distributed with complete corresponding source under a license that is OSI-approved and/or categorized by the FSF as free (collectively "Other FOSS").  We therefore hereby grant the following additional permission with respect to the use and distribution of the Software with Other FOSS, and the constants, function signatures, data structures and other invocation methods used to run or interact with each of them (as to each, such software's "Interfaces"):<p>(i) The Software's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the license of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in the Other FOSS in order to enable interoperability, without requiring a change to the license of the Other FOSS other than as to any Interfaces of the Software embedded therein.  The Software's Interfaces remain at all times under the Software License, including without limitation as used in the Other FOSS (which upon any such use also then contains a portion of the Software under the Software License).<p>(ii) The Other FOSS's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the license of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in the Software in order to enable interoperability, without requiring that such Interfaces be licensed under the terms of the Software License or otherwise altering their original terms, if this does not require any portion of the Software other than such Interfaces to be licensed under the terms other than the Software License.<p>(iii) If only Interfaces and no other code is copied between the Software and the Other FOSS in either direction, the use and/or distribution of the Software with the Other FOSS shall not be deemed to require that the Other FOSS be licensed under the license of the Software, other than as to any Interfaces of the Software copied into the Other FOSS.  This includes, by way of example and without limitation, statically or dynamically linking the Software together with Other FOSS after enabling interoperability using the Interfaces of one or both, and distributing the resulting combination under different licenses for the respective portions thereof.<p>For avoidance of doubt, a license which is OSI-approved or categorized by the FSF as free, includes, for the purpose of this permission, such licenses with additional permissions, and any license that has previously been so-approved or categorized as free, even if now deprecated or otherwise no longer recognized as approved or free.  Nothing in this additional permission grants any right to distribute any portion of the Software on terms other than those of the Software License or grants any additional permission of any kind for use or distribution of the Software in conjunction with software other than Other FOSS.<p>When referring to the exception, you may link to it here at <a href=http://oss.oracle.com/licenses/universal-foss-exception target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">http://oss.oracle.com/licenses/universal-foss-exception</a>.</section></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class=col><div class=btnwrapper_gsW7><button class=modalopenbtn_jIdz>피드백</button></div></div><div class="col lastUpdated_JAkA"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="문서 탐색"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href=/whatap-docs/license/licenses><div class=pagination-nav__sublabel>이전</div><div class=pagination-nav__label>라이선스</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href=/whatap-docs/license/license-open-sources-lib><div class=pagination-nav__sublabel>다음</div><div class=pagination-nav__label>라이브러리 표기</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class=fbsharebutton_dZBI data-href=https://docs.whatap.io/whatap-docs/license/license-open-sources data-layout="" data-size=""><button type=button class=fb_xfbml_parse_ignore_BpHP>공유</button></div><div class=btnprint_EBmh><button>PDF</button></div><div class=btnwrapper_gsW7><button class=modalopenbtn_jIdz>피드백</button></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class=footer__copyright>Copyright © 2025 WhaTap Labs Inc.
